WOODS               The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,               but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm               is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are               obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.               EXT. WOOD'S EDGE               They break through the other side of the woods, emerging               behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly               GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's               horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to               hide beneath the palisade.               The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden               shield. Cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire, grabs               Captain Malcolm, and hauls him behind the fortification.                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                              (bellowing)                         Fall back into the woods! Out of                         your saddles before you're shot out                         of 'em!               The Rangers leap from their saddles as a new sound starts               -- a dull roar that grows and approaches and BBRRRRAPPPPP               as, unbelievably, trees EXPLODE INTO SPLINTERS and horses               and men go down in a heap!                                     COLE                         Gatling! They've got a Gatling!                                     BOB                         Dammit, this stopped being fun                         about two years ago!               Some men are crawling to the fortifications, others are               staying in the woods. The Captain pokes his head up to take               a look. With him WE SEE               EXT. ANOTHER HILLSIDE               At the top of which, about a hundred fifty yards off, is a               three man Gatling crew. Squads of Union soldiers are               beginning to make their way down the hillside. And just to               their right is an EIGHT INCH CANNON with a burning fuse --               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         DOWN!               BOOM! And with a whistle the cannonball TEARS THROUGH the               forest and EXPLODES just behind the Rangers. Some of the men               are screaming from injury and panic.                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM  (CONT'D)                         Cole! Bob! You boys okay?                                     COLE                         Hell, take more than a cannon to                         kill the Younger brothers, sir!                                     BOB                         I think the cannon's doing a pretty                         good job, Cole.               A full-blooded Indian, COMANCHE TOM, crawls up next to them.                                     COLE                         Some Indian tracker you turned out                         to be, Tom.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You pay me to find you Bluecoats.                         There they are.               ANOTHER ROUND from the Gatling chews up the trees and               fencing, driving their heads down.                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         They're using the Gatling and the                         cannon to cover their advance. We're                         pinned unless we take them out!               Cole peers through the rails.                                     COLE                         Those gunners are too far away...                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         Get me the James boy.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You want Jesse?                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         Not Jesse, the one who can shoot.               Comanche Tom rolls back to the edge of the woods.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         FRANK!               EXT. WOODS - A FEW YARDS BACK               Among the squatting men a single one STANDS UP. FRANK JAMES               is tall with a dark, thoughtful face. He looks sadder than               his 23 years should allow.  His hand is wrapped around a               longbarrel Enfield 30.                                     FRANK                         Jesse.               The long rider behind him turns around. He's JESSE JAMES,               20. He's too damn good-looking and he's got your best               friend's eyes. There's a coiled energy to him, and right now               he seems more angry than afraid. Next to him is WEB MIMMS,               15, who is terrified and trying not to show it.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Watch Web.                                     WEB                         I don't need watchin'!

(then)                         Careful, Frank. And make sure Bob                         and Cole are okay.               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS               Loose shots spitting up dirt and wood chips everywhere.               Frank crawls up, nods to the Youngers, peers through the               stacked wood. Another EXPLOSION from the cannon.                                     FRANK                         Cannon or Gatling?                                     COLE                         Both would be nice.                                     FRANK                         Soon as I hit one, the other'll                         know and beat us up.                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         Cannon.               Frank raises his head just high enough to poke the Enfield               over the stacked fenceposts. Everyone else is flinching from               the suppressing fire. Frank is perfectly still. Squinting,               aiming, perfectly centered ... BANG.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. CANNON STATION               As the Captain of the six man crew SNAPS BACK and hits the               ground dead. Before the others can react, two more grab               their throats and drop. The remaining soldiers bolt from the               cannon.               But the Gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels               BLAZE.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS               Frank and the others hit the dirt as the Gatling shreds the               fenceposts, fells trees, churns the ground, stitching a path               of destruction across the bulwarks and into the woods where               EXT. WOODS               The Gatling rounds are everywhere. Rangers jerk as the               Gatling tears them apart. Jesse grabs Web to his chest and               swings around, shielding the boy with his own body. When the               fire pauses for a moment. Jesse looks down -- he's covered               in blood. He lets Web fall away. Blood bubbles up from where               the boy's chest used to be.                                     JESSE                         Hell no...               Jesse's trying to stop the blood with his bare hands.

He's seen too much death to cry anymore. He               stands up, pivots, and strides for the fencepost barrier.               Rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him, but he               keeps walking.               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS               Frank, the Younger brothers, Comanche Tom and the Captain               are all still there. Captain Malcolm peers through the wall.                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         They're getting closer.               Jesse arrives, slaps Cole's shoulder. Cole grins grimly.

They start               firing back, but they can't draw a bead. Two more are down.               Jesse's making every bullet count.               ANGLE ON               The Gatling gun as the crew swings it around and FIRES,               hundred of rounds tearing straight at Jesse               ANGLE ON               Jesse who incredibly cuts the horse hard left using just               his knees, still shooting as the Gatling volley goes wide,               actually killing two of the Union soldiers behind Jesse.               But then the arc of fire takes Jesse's horse in the rump.               The horse falls, but Jesse dives off, still firing, killing               another two soldiers. Then he hits the ground, rolls, and is               up and running, dropping the spent Colts and drawing the two               shoulder guns in one smooth motion, never interrupting his               shooting.

HILLSIDE               -- BANG as the Gatling triggerman drops, BANG as the               ammo-feeder goes down, and BANG as the third man falls               before the echo of the first shot clears.               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS               Cole is the first one on his feet.                                     COLE                         WAAAHHHHOOOO!! We're coming Jesse!                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM                         Charge!               With a ragged cheer the RANGERS ERUPT FROM THE FOREST, some               actually on horseback, firing at the exposed Union troops.               EXT. HILLSIDE               Soldiers are swarming Jesse, but he's moving, turning, an               untouchable blur in the chaos. As he drops two more empty               Colts and reaches for the last two at his back, a SOLDIER               just an arm's length away BRINGS UP A RIFLE.                                     JESSE                         Oh, you do not!               Jesse grabs the rifle barrel and drives the butt straight               back into the soldier's nose. The Union boy falls, releasing               the gun. Jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc, bashing               another soldier in the jaw, and then spins it effortlessly               into his opposite hand and FIRES it point blank into another               Union soldier.               ANGLE ON               The Rangers PLOWING INTO the Union soldiers. Rattled, the               Union troops are beginning to break and fall back.               ANGLE ON               Jesse as another nearby soldier draws a revolver. Jesse               snags his hand, twists it, wrapping the man's arm backward               around Jesse's waist. With the other man still gripping the               weapon, Jesse FANS THE HAMMER as he turns, shooting six more               Union soldiers as they try to rush him. With a final yank,               Jesse pulls the Colt from the man and crashes it down on his               skull.               ANGLE ON               the Union soldiers in full retreat.               EXT. THE GATLING STATION               The few remaining Bluecoats break and run as Jesse reaches               the Gatling. Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the               Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's               cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure               jumps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest!               Jesse gasps, then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has               lodged right in the ""X"" of the ammo belts on his chest,               stopped by the bullets and leather. Jesse kicks. As the               Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smoothly snap-kicks to               his feet and draws both remaining Colts. He pulls up short.               It's a fifteen year old boy, Web Mimms in a blue uniform.               There's a deadly pause.                                     JESSE                         You ain't even been with a girl,                         have you?               The boy shakes his head. Jesse waves him off with the guns.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Git.               The boy scurries off. Jesse turns and lopes down the hill.               Instantly he's surrounded by cheering Missouri Rangers.               EXT. HILLSIDE               The Rangers move past Jesse. Jesse suddenly realizes Frank               is there. They fall into step together.                                     JESSE                         Distracting enough for you?                                     FRANK                         Pff. They hardly even noticed you.                                     JESSE                         So you're saying I could have done                         more to attract their attention.                                     FRANK                         Mm-hmm.                                     JESSE                         Such as?                                     FRANK                         You could have worn one of those                         big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday                         hats.                                     JESSE                         That would have made an impression.                                     FRANK                         I figure.                                     JESSE                         See, that's your problem, Frank. By                         the time you finish figuring out                         stuff, I'm already finished doing it.                                     FRANK                         No, Jesse, your problem is you're                         always doing stuff before I'm                         finished figuring it out.               Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP on their recovered               horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a bear hug.                                     COLE                         Wait'll we get back to Missouri,                         start telling those gals about how                         little Jesse James charged the whole                         Union Army by himself!                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You ride like a Comanche.                                     BOB                         You can ride like that?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I said like a Comanche, not this                         Comanche.               Cole mounts up, reaches down a hand to Jesse.                                     COLE                         Ride with me, cousin?                                     JESSE                         I could use the walk.                                     COLE                         Suit yourself. We'll have some                         horses waiting for you at the road.                              (then)                         Let's ride, Rangers!               Cole slaps leather and the Rangers canter off. As they               disappear we hear:                                     BOB                              (low)                         Now, I would just sound stupid                         saying something like that...               Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walking again.                                     JESSE                              (finally)                         Web's dead.                                     FRANK                         I reckoned.                                     JESSE                         Hell of a war.                                     FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a good idea                         at the time.               EXT. ROAD - DUSK               The James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers               ride down a dirt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate               soldiers. The grey uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight.               The men are obviously broken, dispirited. The column               stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye               can see.               Jesse and the other Rangers ride into the midst of the               Confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a               slow-moving river.               For a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie               procession glides past.                                     COLE                         Where you boys going?                                     JESSE                         There's Yankees back there. Lot's                         of 'em.               One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody               sling, looks up at Jesse.                                     VETERAN                         War's over, son. General Lee                         surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.               The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into the middle               distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face.                                     FRANK                         Yesterday.                                     BOB                         Well, somebody better go tell THE                         DAMN YANKEES!                                     COLE                         What do we do now?               Jesse seems to be the only one with a clear head.                                     JESSE                         Home. We go home. We ride like hell                         to get there, and we kill anything                         or anyone that comes between us and                         our homes. And when we get there we                         stay there and God help any fool who                         tries to get me to leave my farm                         again.                                     BOB                              (pause)                         Best damn plan I heard all war.               Jesse jerks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of               the Missouri Rangers trot off into the sunset.               MONTAGE               -- Jesse, Frank, the Youngers and Comanche Tom riding hard               down country roads, past burned out farms.               THE RIDERS               Are struggling through a downpour in a pitch black night,               one of the horses slipping, going down.               BLAZING SUN               On a dusty road, the Youngers sharing a horse now,               everybody just trying to keep moving.               EXT. HILLTOP - DAY               Jesse, Frank, Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom are looking down               on the frontier town of Liberty, Missouri.                                     FRANK                         Hello, Liberty Missoura!                                     JESSE                         All this time in the saddle... We                         get to the farm, I'm going to shoot                         this damn horse just on principle.                                     COLE                         Never thought that pissant town                         would look so pretty.                                     BOB                         Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is                         pretty.                                     JESSE                         Home, boys. Back to our farms.                                     COLE                         Planting corn. Harvesting corn.                         Year after year.                                     BOB                         Corn gonna shoot at me?                                     FRANK                         Nope.                                     BOB                         Then I love it.               They start to ride down into town.                                     COLE                         Tom, why don't you stop at our                         spread before you head on out to the                         reservation? Figure we might have                         some work for you, if you want.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Hmm. Go back to the reservation and                         get drunk in a dirt shack, or work                         for you...                                     COLE                         Well?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I'm thinking...               Cole throws a playful punch at Comanche Tom.               EXT. LIBERTY STREET - DAY               The gang is riding into the main stretch of town. They're               grinning, happy to be home, until --                                     JESSE                         We got problems.               DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS are walking along the boardwalk,               lingering near the saloon, all suddenly staring at the               riders.                                     COLE                         What the --                                     FRANK                         Must be a garrison in town. We're                         in occupied territory, boys.               Cole is returning stares.                                     JESSE                         Hands off your hip, Cole.                                     COLE                         You're not scared, are you?                                     JESSE                         Pick your fights, cousin. You                         taught me that.                                     BOB                         It gets worse.               There in the center of town, is a brand new scaffold. Three               bodies, fresh ones, are hanging from the nooses.                                     FRANK                         Jesus mercy, that's Charlie                         Higgins, Dave Laller ...                                     BOB                         ...

The riders stop at the scaffold, take off their hats.                                     JESSE                         Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the                         only casualty this town's got.                                     FRANK                         We better go to Doc's, see what's                         going on here.                                     COLE                         I'm cutting them down.               Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Union               Soldiers have started to form a crowd                                     JESSE                         Not now.                                     COLE                         What is wrong with you?                                     JESSE                              (low)                         In case we have to kill these                         sonofabitches, I don't want them to                         see us coming.               Cole thinks, nods. They ride away from the scaffold.                                     BOB                         Cole, I want to get to the farm,                         make sure Little Jim and the girls                         are okay.

The Youngers and Comanche Tom split off, start to trot away.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I think I may just go on to the                         reservation.                                     BOB                         Tom, I'm this close to coming with                         you...               EXT. MIMMS HOME - DAY               Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white two-story               frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees.               ANOTHER ANGLE               They dismount and walk up to the porch. A FARM HAND in a               cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch.                                     JESSE                         Scuse me, we're here for the Doctor.               The farm hand turns and pulls off his hat -- her hat. She's               a chestnut-haired beauty in her late teens, ZERELDA MIMMS.                                     ZEE                         Jesse! Frank!               She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously,               immediately smitten.                                     JESSE                         Zerelda?

JESSE                         But you got big!               Zee arches an eyebrow.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I mean, you aged --               Zee arches both eyebrows.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I mean, I mean, in a good way you                         got big and older.               Zee tilts her head. Jesse's mouth moves, but nothing comes               out, until                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Frank, don't you have something to                         say?

JESSE                              (pulling it together)                         Zee, we got to talk to you and your                         father.               DOC MIMMS, a grey-haired man wearing rimless spectacles,               steps out of the doorway.

We can see, but not hear,               Jesse talking. A beat, then we hear Zee CRY OUT.  Doc Mimms               staggers, SLUMPS DOWN in the door frame. Jesse and Frank               rush to help him.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. PARLOR - A WHILE LATER               The room is comfortable and elegant in a simple way. Doc               Mimms is slumped in a big chair. Zee, her eyes red, is               pushing a glass of sherry into his hands. Jesse and Frank               sit across from him.                                     JESSE                         -- rode right into them, screaming                         like a banshee.

He jumped his horse clear over                         our heads, killed a dozen Union                         soldiers before they knew what hit                         them.               Jesse looks at Frank, urging him on.                                     FRANK                         Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling                         gun and the cannon all by himself.                                     JESSE                         Saved all our lives, Doc. None of                         the Liberty boys would have come                         home if not for Web Mimms, Doc.                         God's honest truth.

Don't end up like Charlie.                         They found out Charlie rode with                         Quantrill's Raiders. They arrested                         him, tried him by military tribunal                         and hanged him this morning.                                     FRANK                         I thought there was general amnesty.                                     DOC MIMMS                         For soldiers, yes.

And                         you boys are in more danger, because                         you've got a farm.               Jesse and Frank don't understand.

Then                         they start hanging men who own farms                         for treason?

ZEE  (CONT'D)                         I'm going to go cry now, so I don't                         have time for your lies. But I'll                         see you Saturday.               Zee kisses her fingertips and extends them to the boys,               then disappears into the house.

Jesse's still staring at the door.  Frank rides back, takes               Jesse's horse by the reins.  As Frank turns Jesse's horse               and leads it away, Jesse's head keeps pivoting, fixed on the               door. After a moment, Jesse turns to look forward, taking               his reins.               The brothers ride away slowly.

Out of the farmhouse bursts MA               JAMES, a big, rugged frontier woman who is absolutely               hysterical.                                     MA                         My boys!

FRANK                         Well look at Jimmy Younger. You're                         all grown up.                                     JIM                              (mouth full)                         Mmmph-hmpph.                                     BOB                              (sheepishly)                         Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until                         we ate something.                                     COLE                         That was two hours ago.                                     MA                         I don't see clean plates.               The men dutifully return to the meal. Jesse nods his head               at Comanche Tom.                                     JESSE                              (quiet)                         Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice                         to our Injun friend.                                     MA                         He's a good Christian and he killed                         Yankees. Jesus told me that made him                         an all right boy.               Ma WALKS OFF.                                     FRANK                         She's still talking to Jesus.                                     JESSE                         What worries me is that Jesus is                         talking back.               EXT. JAMES FARM               We can hear the laughter from inside the lit house. Night               falls and                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY - A FEW WEEKS LATER               Like a time-lapse film we see the surrounding trees have               filled out, the stone fence is repaired, the shabby paint               redone in sparkling white. Jesse and Cole, shirtless, are               driving a post into a hole. Frank STEPS OUT of the house and               joins them.                                     JESSE                         You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?                                     COLE                         She got two of them.                                     FRANK                         I think one of 'em's glass.                                     COLE                         Which one, right or left?                                     FRANK                         The brown one.                                     JESSE                              (to Cole)                         You talk big for a man who screwed                         another man back in Atlanta.               Frank laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse.                                     FRANK                         Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at                         Bunty's...                                     COLE                         Sadie was not a man!                                     JESSE                         She had a moustache.                                     COLE                         She was European!                                     JESSE                         All right, calm down. I'll agree                         Sadie was a woman --               Jesse and Frank swallow their laughs.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         -- if you stop saying things about                         my Zee.                                     FRANK                         Your Zee? Hmm.                              (quoting)                         ""From women's eyes this doctrine I                         derive: they sparkle still the right                         Promethean fire; They are the books,                         the arts, the academes, that show,                         contain, and nourish all the world.""                                     COLE                         I have no idea what you just said,                         but it sounded real nice.                                     FRANK                         Shakespeare.                              (pause)                         He's European.                                     COLE                         Ah.                                     JESSE                         You want to write that down for me                         so I can say it to Zee?               The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and               Cole shrug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Thanks for the help.                                     COLE                         After all you did on our farm?                              (sips, then)                         You miss it, don't you Jesse?                                     JESSE                         The war? What, are you crazy?                              (beat)                         There are things I miss about it.                                     COLE                         It was exciting.                                     JESSE                         But it was a whole lot of killing.                         Why should we miss that?                                     COLE                         Because we were good at it?  Hell,                         we were great at it. Jesse, don't                         tell anyone I said this, because                         everybody knows I'm the toughest man                         in this town, but you are one                         terrifying sonofabitch with those                         guns.                                     JESSE                              (regretful, but not)                         Yeah.               Frank looks at Jesse thoughtfully. Then all three notice               ANGLE ON               A BUGGY that stops at the edge of the property. Ma STEPS               OUT onto the porch next to Frank to meet:               A man in a suit, ROLLIN PARKER, and three riders who               dismount and flank Parker: two DETECTIVES and a big Scot               with a beard and no moustache, ALAN PINKERTON. Pinkerton is               wearing a suit and a gun in a high waistband. All four               advance to the house.                                     PARKER                         Howdy, folks. How are you this                         afternoon?                                     COLE                         ""Howdy""?                                     JESSE                         Easterners.                                     MA                         We're just fine, thank you, sir.                                     PARKER                         I am Rollin H. Parker, personal                         emissary of Mr. Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad. These two                         gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives,                         working for Mr. Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad, and this gentleman                         here is the famous Alan Pinkerton,                         founder of the Secret Service and                         now working under contract to Mr.                         Thaddeus Rains.                                     JESSE                         Would that be Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad?                                     FRANK                         You know him?                                     JESSE                         Heard of him.                                     PARKER                              (trying to regain                              control)                         As you have no doubt heard from                         your neighbors, our railroad is                         moving west.                                     JESSE                         That makes sense, as east would put                         you underwater.               Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and               continues.                                     PARKER                         ... moving west, opening the                         frontier for folks such as yourself.                         Your acreage here is on the proposed                         right of way.               Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes it.                                     PARKER  (CONT'D)                         I'm here for your signature on this                         land sales contract. I'm authorized                         to pay you two dollars an acre.                                     MA                         Two dollars?                                     PARKER                         That's right. That's the price                         authorized by the railroad's board,                         and approved by the Department of                         the Interior of the Government of                         the United States of America.                                     MA                         This land ain't for sale.               Pinkerton steps forward.                                     PINKERTON                         Ma'am, I can understand how you                         might feel that way -- you've made a                         lovely home here. But it's really                         not up to me or you. Are you                         familiar with the legal concept of                         the Right of Eminent Domain?                                     FRANK                         Yeah, I am. What about it?               Parker is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in               these farmers.                                     PINKERTON                         Well, this land is about to be                         condemned.                                     PARKER                         I'm doing you folks a favor --                                     COLE                         Said the skinner to the mule.                                     PARKER                         -- with a price of two dollars an                         acre for this one time only offer.                         After today the price goes down. So                         if I were you, I'd just sign the                         contract, and I'll be on my way.               Frank takes the contract from Ma and hands it back to               Parker.                                     FRANK                         Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell                         Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where                         the sun don't shine.                              (to the boys)                         Shakespeare.                                     JESSE/COLE                         Ah.               Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest their               hands on their guns.                                     PINKERTON                         I don't think you understand. You                         don't have a choice.               CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn and cocked two Colts               from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his rifle from the               doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but               Pinkerton seems no more than curious.                                     PARKER                              (to Ma)                         Ma'am. You have to look in your                         heart and do what you know is right                         here.                                     MA                         Let me ask the Lord.               Ma bows her head for a moment. She then nods and looks up.                                     MA  (CONT'D)                         The Lord says we can bury 'em out                         back in the orchard, nobody'll ever                         find them.                                     JESSE                         Somebody's in a vengeful smiting                         mood today.                                     FRANK                         Why don't we just let them go for                         today, Ma. We'll bury them out back                         next time.                                     MA                         Oh all right.               Parker, and the detectives are stepping backward to the               buggy.                                     PARKER                         You people are making a serious                         mistake!               Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group.                                     PINKERTON                              (nodding)                         Nicely played.               Parker, Pinkerton and the detectives RIDE OFF. The group at               the James house watches them go, then Cole turns to Jesse.                                     COLE                         Where the hell did you get those                         guns?               OFF JESSE'S SHRUG WE                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT               Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room               school house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is               leading the meeting.                                     FRANK                         I went up to the courthouse and                         looked at the right of way documents                         for the rail bed. The railroad                         doesn't even need our land, they're                         just taking the land on both sides                         for as far as they can.                                     JESSE                         Damn. All that reading paid off.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Floor recognizes Clell Miller.               CLELL MILLER, tall and blond, steps forward.                                     CLELL                         They're saying we don't sell, we                         might end up with nothing!                                     FRANK                         That's only if we don't stick                         together.

LONI                         I say this is the last straw. I                         came back from the war, I found my                         house burned down. My cows was dead.                         Now my wife's run off with my                         cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch.

FARMER                         I'm tired of fighting. I'm just                         gonna take my family and move west.                                     CLELL                         Maybe we should hire a lawyer.                                     FARMER 2                         That's a good idea!                                     FRANK                         It would be, if the courts were on                         the up and up.                                     CLELL                         So what do we do?               ANGLE ON               the school house door as it BANGS open and Bob Younger               STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a cut on his forehead, being               supported by Zee.                                     BOB                         They got Cole.               He collapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him.                                     ZEE                         He came to our house, Daddy. I                         figured you'd all want to hear this.               Jesse and Frank are next to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's               shoulder. He notices.                                     BOB                         They came up, made the same offer                         they made you folks. Our little                         brother Jim tried to chase 'em off,                         one of those detectives hit him in                         the head, knocked him out. Cole lost                         his temper.                                     FRANK                              (rubbing his                              forehead)                         Oh no...                                     BOB                         He just lost his temper a little.                                     JESSE                              (sighing)                         How many of them did he kill?                                     BOB                         Two.                                     FRANK                         Damn!                                     BOB                         They said because the detectives                         were working for the Department of                         the Interior --                                     FRANK                         The Army can hang him.                                     BOB                         Tomorrow.                                     CLELL                         What do we do?                                     JESSE                         Nothing.               The crowd stares at Jesse.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         You folks are going to do nothing.                         You're all going to go home right                         now. So you're going to be able to                         swear on a Bible that you don't know                         anything about what's going to                         happen tomorrow.               Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying. The crowd               quietly begins to disperse.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Boys...                                     JESSE                         Go home, Doc.                              (softly)                         They ain't gonna hang no more                         Liberty boys.               Doc Mimms nods, EXITS.               Jesse walks to the other end of the school house. Bob,               Frank, Clell and Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS               OPEN again and Comanche Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting               six-guns way too big for him.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I couldn't lose him.                                     BOB                         Jim Younger, I told you--                                     JIM                         It's my fault they're gonna hang                         Cole. I want in.                                     FRANK                         Jim, it was just a matter of time                         before they tried to hang somebody                         else to scare off the other farmers.                                     JESSE                         And you're too young.                                     JIM                              (to Jesse)                         I'm the same age you were when you                         went off to war.                                     JESSE                         And the same age Web was. No.                                     ZEE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         You're wasting time.               Zee joins them.                                     JESSE                         Zee, go home.               Zee's eyebrows go up.                                     ZEE                         Who else was there when they hanged                         the others?               The men look at each other. Nothing.                                     ZEE  (CONT'D)                         You need to know how they do it.                         Which way they walk up. What order                         they do things in. And if you mess                         up rescuing Cole because you won't                         listen to a woman, then God damn you                         all.               Pause.                                     JESSE                         All right. Seven of us against a                         Union regiment and Pinkerton                         detectives in broad daylight in the                         middle of Main Street.               Jesse smiles.                                     BOB                         He's smiling.                                     JIM                         Is that bad?                                     FRANK                         Very.               EXT. LIBERTY CITY GALLOWS - THE NEXT DAY               Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bottom of               the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark               rhythm.               Parker is watching this like a sideshow. Pinkerton is next               to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is getting larger               and surlier by the minute.                                     PARKER                         Relax, Alan. The Army has this all                         in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will                         be very pleased with this news.                         Nothing like a hanging to motivate                         the populace to relocate.                                     PINKERTON                         It's not my job to relax. I've put                         men facing out both ways down Main                         Street, so nobody can ride in                         shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up                         on the water tower just in case.               Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. WATER TOWER               We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit, who WAVES BACK and               then kneels and sights down his long rifle. Tucked away               behind him, out of sight from the street, is a               bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. GALLOWS               Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the               stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman.               LONG SHOT               of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on               both sides, guns ready. The position is completely               unassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in               front of him. The noose is placed on his neck.               BACK TO               The gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION               LIEUTENANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his               face. The CROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the               HANGMAN, who grabs the lever --               The drums STOP --               But the drumming doesn't.               The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army men               and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's               definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer...               The CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the               gallows...               The drumming gets LOUDER ...               EXT. STREET               REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the               street, their hooves creating the drumming!               REACTION SHOTS as the Pinkertons and Army men start to               scatter, the cattle surging around them --               EXT. VIEWING STAND               ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pinkerton running for cover,               Pinkerton half-turned to watch the action.                                     PINKERTON                         Brilliant...               Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW his               stare to see --               ANGLE ON               a HORSE in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the               steer, towards the gallows.               THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS HE               DOES -               Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side of the horse,               where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a leg up on               the horse's back and LEAPS --               SLAMMING into the Hangman, bringing him down!               The cattle pass the gallows, revealing that the tight ranks               of the Army and Pinkertons are now spread out --               EXT. GENERAL STORE               SMASH! From the nearby GENERAL STORE, the other masked               rescuers CRASH through the big front window on horseback and               ride into the Army men, FIRING AWAY.               TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the               gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the               Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as               Frank opens fire.               Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives and               remaining soldiers are completely disoriented.               EXT. GALLOWS               Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from Cole's               neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists --               Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster,               spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing               the stairs behind Jesse's back.  Jesse and Cole exchange a               look, then Jesse steps away --               As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT into the air.               Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by, spins               and starts shooting.               EXT. MAIN STREET               The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse               led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON               and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and               the horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd.               Allen Pinkerton steps past the panicking troops, squarely               in the path of the charging horse. He draws his gun and               FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as the terrified               horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton.               Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the               street. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower.               The soldiers fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the               detectives runs over to the injured Alan Pinkerton.                                     DETECTIVE                         Sir, are you all right?                              (shout)                         Somebody get a doctor!               EXT. MIMMS HOME - NIGHT               WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on.               INT. BEDROOM               Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who lies               unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp.                                     ZEE                         He's going to be fine, right Daddy?                                     DOC MIMMS                         The bullet came out clean, but he                         lost a whole lot of blood. Praying                         wouldn't hurt.               The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside.               INT. LIVING ROOM               Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of               soldiers push in.                                     OFFICER                         Good evening, sir, we're looking                         for a fugitive.                                     DOC MIMMS                         A fugitive? Who?                                     OFFICER                         We don't know, but he was very                         badly wounded. We're checking all                         the houses in the area.               INT. BEDROOM               Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the               stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest               and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her               neck, completely hiding him.               At that moment, the Officer barges in. Zee lets out a               little gasp as if startled awake. She covers herself with               the quilt.                                     ZEE                         Sir! Who are you?                                     OFFICER                         Oh. Sorry ma'am.                                     ZEE                         I should hope so.               The Officer EXITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then               looks down fondly at Jesse.                                     ZEE  (CONT'D)                         Jesse, are you awake?                                     JESSE                              (groggy)                         Mmmm.               Zee gently pushes his hair off his face. Then her               expression changes.                                     ZEE                         Jesse, is that your hand?                                     JESSE                         Nuh-huh ...               Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and               wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters.                                     DOC MIMMS                         They're gone. What are you --                                     ZEE                         I fooled them into thinking I was                         alone.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Well, I hope the boy pulls through.                         We should know in the morning.                                     ZEE                              (with a little smile)                         I think he's already feeling better.               A puzzled Doc Mimms follows her out.               EXT. LIBERTY MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON - TWO WEEKS LATER               A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the               nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue of               Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door.               The DOOR OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an               elegant suit he bought in London last year and a scowl he               picked up in Boston three decades ago. The scowl fits him               better.                                     PARKER                         Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a                         pleasure to have you join us in the                         field.                                     RAINS                         And it is my pleasure to be here.                                     PARKER                         Really!                                     RAINS                         NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have                         to leave my board room to come to                         this godforsaken piece of dirt to                         discover why in the name of all that                         is holy you cannot seem to evict a                         few simple farmers from their                         PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I                         may build the GREATEST railroad that                         this country has ever seen!                                     PARKER                         I can completely understand your                         distress, sir.               Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold, ornate               and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN.                                     RAINS                         Parker, tell me what's going on so                         I can return as quickly as possible                         to Boston and my whores and cigars,                         not necessarily in that order.                                     PARKER                         Two weeks ago, we managed to                         arrange to have the Army hang one of                         the local farmers.                                     RAINS                         Good.                                     PARKER                         Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of                         local thugs managed to rescue him                         from the gallows. Not only has this                         inspired resistance from the other                         farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan                         Pinkerton was seriously injured                         during the incident.                                     RAINS                         Leaving you in charge of operations                         until he recovers.                                     PARKER                              (puffing with pride)                         Yes sir.                                     RAINS                         Just perfect.                                     PARKER                         A further impediment is that the                         Army garrison has been ordered to                         move on from Liberty. We will no                         longer have that particular stick                         with which to threaten the farmers.                                     RAINS                         You see the Army leaving and you                         see the loss of a tool. I see a                         power void to be filled. As we have                         the most power, we may move with                         impunity.                                     PARKER                         I see. I'll get together four                         patrols of our detectives for action                         tonight.                                     RAINS                         I'll teach these podunks what                         happens when they challenge the                         righteousness of progress.               EXT. MIMMS HOME - AFTERNOON - THAT SAME DAY               Zee is on the porch. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving               gingerly. Zee immediately moves to support him.                                     ZEE                         You shouldn't be up.                                     JESSE                         I've been on my back two weeks. I'm                         sick of it.                                     ZEE                         You're sick of my company?                                     JESSE                         No! I mean, of course not. No.                                     ZEE                         Teasing you is completely unfair.                                     JESSE                         What you do to me is unfair. The                         teasing, I mean.                                     ZEE                         I shouldn't tease a hero.                                     JESSE                         What?                                     ZEE                         Everybody in the county knows it                         was you who rescued Cole. We're all                         so proud of you, Jesse. And not a                         single farm's been sold to the                         railroad since. You're everybody's                         hero.                                     JESSE                         I wasn't the only one risking my                         neck that day.                                     ZEE                         So you're saying I should leave you                         alone and go spend time with Jimmy                         Younger?                                     JESSE                         Unfair. You are completely unfair.               They look at each other warmly. Frank DRIVES UP in a               carriage.                                     FRANK                         You ready to stop loafing around                         with this young lady and get back to                         farming?                                     JESSE                         What do you think?                                     FRANK                         Would you get in the carriage?                         Until Ma has you home so she can                         fuss over you herself, she's gonna                         make me miserable.               Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the porch.                                     JESSE                         What do you say, sir?                                     DOC MIMMS                         Go on. You're pretty much all                         healed up.               Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into               the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the               carriage.                                     FRANK                         You're looking a bit more spry now                         that somebody --                                     JESSE                              (to Frank)                         Shut up.                              (to Doc Mimms)                         Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,                         this evening, I could come by?                                     DOC MIMMS                         You know you're welcome any time!                                     JESSE                              (unusually awkward)                         Yesss, but I was thinking, I could                         come by, and then take Zee out. Some                         place near. With other folk. Near.                         Here.                              (beat)                         But out.                                     DOC MIMMS                              (bemused)                         It's fine by me, Jesse.                                     FRANK                         Don't worry, sir, I'll make sure                         they're always properly chaperoned.               Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank.                                     DOC MIMMS                              (grinning)                         Why, that hadn't even occurred to                         me, Frank. I am deeply in your debt.                                     FRANK                         Army's leaving town, so Cole can                         stop hiding up in the woods and come                         back to his farm. Everybody's                         getting together at the Younger                         place for a to-do.               Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF.               EXT. BARNYARD - NIGHT               Dozens of people are milling about happily in the lantern               light of a Western party. Some are dancing to the small               banjo-led band. A small knot of men are comparing war               stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people               clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand.               Jesse -- formally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at               the edge of the light. Immediately the entire group bursts               into applause and crowds Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear               hugs Jesse, making him wince.                                     COLE                         Here's Liberty's favorite son!                              (quietly)                         I'll never forget what you did,                         cousin.                                     BOB                         Zee, I'm pleased you came.                                     ZEE                         Why thank you, Bob.                                     BOB                         I'm especially pleased you came                         with Jesse.                              (off her look)                         Seeing as right now there's a                         gaggle of girls hoping to dance with                         Jesse who are just going to have to                         settle for the many charms of Bob                         Younger.               ANGLE ON               A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women.               Bob runs a hand through his hair.                                     JESSE                         You have no shame.                                     BOB                         Not yet. But I'm hoping.               The party starts up again, and everyone is caught up in the               good times.               ANGLE ON               Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They join in               the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk.               EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT - A WHILE LATER               Jesse, carrying a lantern, and Zee are walking. We can hear               the party still going just a little ways away. They reach a               tree at the hilltop with a beautiful view of the stars and               the river. They sit down, their backs against the tree.                                     JESSE                         I used to come to this tree when I                         was a kid and imagine what my life                         would be like when I got older.                                     ZEE                         You didn't want to farm?                                     JESSE                         I was thinking more along the lines                         of being a river pirate.                                     ZEE                         A river pirate.                                     JESSE                         Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.                                     ZEE                         Thank God you grew out of that.                              (pause)                         You did grow out of that, didn't                         you?                                     JESSE                         Mostly. It would be an all right                         life, for a bachelor.                                     ZEE                         You planning on being a bachelor                         your whole life, Jesse James?                                     JESSE                         Not if I find the right girl.                                     ZEE                         And what's this right girl like?                                     JESSE                         Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes                         me think she's two steps ahead of                         me. And big buck teeth.                                     ZEE                         Where will you find such a girl?                                     JESSE                         Honestly, you'd do if only you had                         the buck teeth.               Zee fakes a monstrous overbite.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (dreamy)                         Finally.               The two move a little closer. Eye contact.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No,                         ah... ""From women's eyes this                         doctrine I derive, they sparkle                         still like ... shiny... sparkling                         rocks...""                                     ZEE                         Sparkling rocks?                                     JESSE                         Little ones.                                     ZEE                         Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare                         poems you're trying to quote?                                     JESSE                         Yep.                                     ZEE                         Were you planning on kissing me                         when you finished quoting?                                     JESSE                         I've been planning on kissin' you                         for a very long time.               They kiss. It's everything it should be.               BOOM!               Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and sound.               They turn to look back --               EXT. YOUNGER BARN               The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which               is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger               brothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked               riders disappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at               the riders, but the distance is too great.               Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bob grabs him.                                     COLE                         BASTARDS! Come back here and face                         me!                                     FRANK                         Get buckets!               Some of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well.               Jesse and Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Pinkertons. It's the railroad.                                     JESSE                         Ma.               Frank and Jesse bolt for their horses, swing into the               saddles and GALLOP OFF.               EXT. JAMES HOUSE               From a bit down the road, looking just fine. Jesse and               Frank reign in as relief rushes across their faces --               AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of               matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full               gallop.               EXT. YARD               Jesse and Frank leap from their mounts, trying to get close               to the house. The flames are too strong.                                     JESSE                         Ma! Ma!               Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank               tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him,               still pacing back and forth in front of the inferno.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ma! Please!                                     MA (O.S.) (O.S.)                              (weakly)                         Boys?               The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock. Ma is               stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally               BURNED.                                     FRANK                         Jesus mercy --               They reach her just as she collapses. Jesse is cradling               her, Frank with his arms around both of them.                                     MA                         Riders --                                     JESSE                         We know, Ma. Now we got to get you                         to Doc Mimms.                                     MA                         Take care of each other, boys. You                         say your prayers.               Jesse is openly crying. Frank has tears silently streaming               down his face.                                     JESSE                         Doc Mimms will --                                     MA                         Shush.               Ma's eyes turn up, and she half-smiles.                                     MA  (CONT'D)                         Well look at that. The Good Lord's                         a bit shorter than I reckoned.               Ma gently stops breathing.               ANGLE ON               The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flames of their               home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF RAGE               AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on...                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. JAMES FARM - MORNING               Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoking ruins of their               lives. Other townsfolk are milling nearby, including Zee and               the Youngers.                                     FRANK                         ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make                         a decent life someplace else.                                     JESSE                         Don't care.                                     FRANK                         Didn't think you would.                              (turning away)                         I'm going to go make the coffin.                                     JESSE                         Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't                         be enough by the time I'm through.               Frank is gone.                                     COLE                         Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy                         Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.                                     BOB                         The sheriff says it was a gang of                         drunk Kansas boys.                                     COLE                         I say we ride into town and kill us                         some Pinkertons and railroad men.                                     JIM                         I like that.                                     JESSE                         No.               They stare at him.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         This isn't a feud, this is war.                         They've got more men than we do. We                         kill detectives, they can replace                         'em in a day.                                     COLE                              (snapping)                         So what do we do, General Lee?                                     JESSE                         Just like in the war. Harass their                         supply lines. We kill the railroad's                         men, they won't care.                                     BOB                         But if we take their money and                         supplies...                                     JESSE                         Exactly.                                     JIM                         That's a great plan, Jesse!               Cole nods grudgingly.                                     BOB                         I'll get us a few more men, and                         Comanche Tom'll ride with us.                                     JIM                         Where do we hit first, Jesse?                                     COLE                         I'll pick the first job! I mean...                         I know a girl down at the bank. See                         if she can't get a list of towns                         where the railroad keeps its money.                                     JESSE                         Perfect, Cole.                                     COLE                         Let's ride.               The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house,               pulls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open,               reaches in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind               him in what remains of the doorway.                                     ZEE                         I am so sorry, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         Frank and me have to go away for a                         while.               Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's.                                     ZEE                         You and I, we've started...                         something, you know?                              (Jesse nods)                         I don't know what'll happen if you                         do this.                                     JESSE                         Me neither.                                     ZEE                         Let the law --                                     JESSE                         Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus                         Rains. Only justice does.                                     ZEE                         Whose justice? Yours or God's?                              (no answer)                         When will you stop?                                     JESSE                         When my name makes them cry in                         their sleep. When I've brought them                         to ashes.               Jesse kisses her gently, turns and walks to where the               Youngers are standing. Zee can barely conceal her anger and               heartbreak.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. FIDELITY BANK AND TRUST - DAY               ESTABLISHING SHOT of a Midwestern bank on a quiet street.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               There are two teller windows, a couple of male customers               and a MOTHER and CHILD.               Jesse and Cole ENTER dressed for the trail, longrider coats               and spurs. Saddlebags are slung over their shoulders.                                     JESSE                         Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,                         but I have bad news. The railroad                         payroll has been stolen.               The BANK MANAGER steps out from behind his desk.                                     MANAGER                         What are you talking about? The                         railroad's money is right over there                         in that safe.               Jesse draws two guns, Cole produces a shotgun from his coat.                                     JESSE                         That safe?

FIDELITY BANK               Frank James, Bob and Jim Younger, Clell Miller, Loni               Packwood, Comanche Tom and several new GANG MEMBERS wait               along both sides of the street in this medium sized               mid-western town. Some are standing next to their horses,               some mounted.               ANOTHER ANGLE               An OLD MAN with a cane is walking shakily towards the bank.               Frank jerks his head and Jim intercepts him.                                     JIM                         Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed                         today.                                     OLD MAN                         Wha?                                     JIM                         Bank holiday! Bank's closed!               Jim tries to steer the old man away. The old man starts               batting at him with the cane.                                     OLD MAN                         Get off me!                                     JIM                         Ow! Ow!               Frank sighs.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               Jesse and the Bank Manager are having a staredown.                                     MANAGER                         This is outrageous. Who are you                         people?                                     JESSE                         The James Gang.

FIDELITY BANK               The old man is still smacking Jim with the cane. Bob               crosses to help.                                     BOB                         Sir, it's a bank holiday --               SMACK SMACK and now the old man's laying the cane on both               Bob and Jim.                                     JIM                         Ow!                                     BOB                         Ow ow!               Frank hangs his head.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               Cole turns to the Woman and Child.                                     COLE                         Ma'am, kindly cover that child's                         eyes.                                     WOMAN                         Why?                                     COLE                         I don't want her to see me shoot                         this man.               The woman covers the child's eyes. Cole raises the shotgun.               Jesse half covers his eyes and turns his head. The Manager               swallows.               EXT. FIDELITY BANK               Comanche Tom walks over to where the old man is still               SMACKING Jim and Bob.                                     OLD MAN                         I know it ain't no durned bank                         holiday!                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You're right, sir.                                     OLD MAN                         Then why can't I go in there?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         On account of we're robbing it.                                     OLD MAN                         Oh. Why didn't you just say so?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         It's a secret.                                     OLD MAN                         Fine. I'll just wait here.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I'd appreciate that.               The old man settles against the wall. Comanche Tom moves               back to his horse. Bob and Jim walk off, glaring at the old               man.               INT. SHERRIFF'S OFFICE               A lean, middle-aged SHERRIFF is walking by his window. His               DEPUTY is whittling at the desk. The Sherriff pulls up short.                                     SHERRIFF                         What the --                                     DEPUTY                         What is it?                                     SHERRIFF                         Old Man Tucker is just standing                         quiet outside the bank.                                     DEPUTY                         So?                                     SHERRIFF                         When have you ever known Old Man                         Tucker not to be yelling at                         everybody?               He takes in the group of riders, reaches for his rifle.               EXT. FIDELITY BANK               Jesse and Cole RUN FROM the bank with full saddlebags.               Everybody MOUNTS UP and starts riding down main street.                                     FRANK                         How'd it go in there?                                     JESSE                         Fine. How'd it go out here?                                     FRANK                         We're gonna have to talk...               BANG! The gang flinches as a chunk of wood splinters from a               post. They turn to see the Sherriff running out in front of               them, raising his rifle --               The entire Gang draws their guns. Jesse raises a hand.                                     JESSE                         Sir, you can do this the smart way,                         or the stupid way. Only one way ends                         with you still breathin'.               The Sherriff takes in the Gang's firepower. He lowers the               rifle.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (to the Gang)                         Just 'cause we're robbing a bank,                         no reason not to be civil about it.               The Gang turns and RIDES OFF hard.               The DEPUTY walks up to the Sherriff a beat later.                                     SHERRIFF                         Where the hell were you?                                     DEPUTY                         I had you covered.

DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT               A bonfire burns in the middle of a rough camp in the woods.               The Gang members are sitting around, relaxing and drinking               coffee. All eyes are on Jesse and Cole as they finish               counting the money.                                     JESSE                         I got seven thousand.                                     COLE                         I got three.                                     BOB                         Ten thousand dollars! That's almost                         a thousand apiece!               The men HOOT AND HOLLER.                                     LONI                         My luck is changing at last!               Cole holds up a pile of papers.                                     COLE                         These are deeds and mortgages of                         farms the bank was holding for the                         railroad.                                     BOB                         Better pass them over here before                         something happens to 'em.               Cole goes to hand the papers to Bob and ""accidentally""               drops them in the fire. The men CHEER again.                                     JESSE                         All right, settle down. All this                         money ain't ours.                                     BOB                         Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's.                         That's why we had to go to all that                         trouble of stealing it.                              (to Frank)                         You explain it to him.                                     JESSE                         We oughta take some of this, give                         it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot                         of people hurting up there.                                     CLELL                         None of them risked their necks for                         this.                                     FRANK                         Now, let's think about this. We                         create some good will with the folks                         hereabouts, make it easier to dodge                         the law.                                     JESSE                         See, Frank's being smart about this.                                     COLE                         Just because he reads all those                         books and knows all those big words                         doesn't make him smart.                                     BOB                         Uhh, yeah it does.                                     COLE                         You stay out of this, Bob.                                     JIM                         I think Jesse's got a good idea --                                     COLE                         You stay out of this too, Jim.                              (to Jesse)                         Who put you in charge of this gang,                         anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine                         leading us during the War.                                     JESSE                         And I planned getting you off the                         hangman's deck --                                     FRANK                         And that's why you both lead the                         gang. Two of you went into that bank                         together, right?               Jesse and Cole nod, still watching each other.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Two heads are better than one. All                         Jesse was doing was making a                         suggestion.               Jesse nods, his face giving nothing up.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         So we're waiting to hear what you                         think of the suggestion. As the                         other leader of the gang.               Cole considers this.                                     COLE                         I reckon it's the smart thing to do.               The other Gang members grumble. Cole whirls on them.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         Hey! We decide something, that's                         it! We're in this for the long haul,                         and this idea of me and Jesse's will                         help give us more places to hide out                         without worrying about some farmer                         with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in                         our sleep. We've got to think --                                     FRANK                         Strategically.                                     COLE                         -- Exactly. Because this is a war.                                     CLELL                         This ain't no war.               The Gang is taken aback by this blatant contradiction. Then               a smile spreads across Clell's face.                                     CLELL  (CONT'D)                         Nobody paid me no thousand dollars                         to fight in the War!               The Gang LAUGHS, and the tension is broken. Jesse and Cole               slap each other's shoulders, and everyone starts counting               their money and talking all at once.               INT. SALOON - DAY               The crowded saloon is alive with music, card-playing, and               dancing girls. Various James Gang members are playing cards               and drinking. Jesse, Cole, and Frank are at the bar.                                     COLE                         It's not a bank.                                     JESSE                         It's better. It's a construction                         depot. They'll have the strongbox                         and some ammo and explosives for us                         to take. That way we can take on a                         bigger job.                                     FRANK                         And it's guarded by Pinkerton                         detectives.                                     JESSE                         And I do so want to shoot some                         Pinkerton detectives.               Jesse and Cole grin and slap each other on the back. Jim               BURSTS in waving a newspaper. He quickly runs to the bar.

The Gang looks at him.               EXT. THAXTON SWITCH DEPOT - NIGHT               Half finished railroad tracks run alongside a few sheds and               an office building.               ANGLE ON               The TRAIN TRACKS as the James-Younger Gang rides at full               gallop. A rapid series of SEQUENTIAL EXPLOSIONS follows               them, destroying the track for hundreds of yards.               EXT. THAXTON SWITCH DEPOT - MORNING               The entire work camp is DESTROYED. SMOKE still hangs over               the twisted wreckage, a few wagons smolder, it looks like               Omaha Beach at D-DAY plus 20.  Thaddeus Rains is surveying               the damage with Parker.                                     PARKER                         They exchanged fire with the                         Pinkerton Guards, killing several of                         them. Then they raided the payroll                         office and blew the tracks for half                         a mile.

The SOUND OF HORSES makes them turn.               ANGLE ON               A fancy carriage that pulls up. WE SEE the ground beneath               the carriage. A boot hits the ground. Then another. Then the               tip of a cane.               REVEAL Alan Pinkerton now moving toward Rains and Parker,               limping from when Jesse's horse trampled him.

They are disciplined, well-trained                         and have a charismatic leader. If I                         were to design the perfect outlaw                         band, this gang is what I would                         create.

COMANCHE TOM  (CONT'D)                         -- you cretins.               Comanche Tom flips the coin over his shoulder. From around               the corner THUNDERS the James Gang. They ride up to the               building marked ""Bank"" right next to the Marshall's office.               The Gang dismounts, runs in.               An improbably short time later, the Gang members run back               out with full saddlebags and mount up. Comanche Tom RIDES               OFF with them.                                     FRANK                         Nice performance, Tom.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I feel dirty.               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MONTHS LATER               The same men in suits and the same map, only now with more               red markers on it.  In the center of the group are Thaddeus               Rains, Rollin Parker and Alan Pinkerton.                                     RAINS                         Pinkerton. It's been eight months.                         I see robberies. I see hold ups. But                         I do not see men on the end of                         nooses.                                     PINKERTON                         All of the James Gang's encounters                         have been with local law enforcement                         who, quite frankly, are no match for                         this group's cunning.                                     PARKER                         What about your detectives? They                         haven't --               Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains               doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that               Alan Pinkerton is a big, violent Scotsman. He never raises               his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to.                                     PINKERTON                              (to Parker)                         First of all: you, shut up.                              (to Rains)                         Now, you've given me a thousand                         miles of railroad to cover. Every                         time the James Gang strikes, we                         shift a hundred detectives to that                         area. But there's just too much open                         land, too many riverbeds to ride,                         caves to hide in. This gang operates                         across four states, often riding a                         hundred miles between jobs.                                     RAINS                         I can't believe this.                                     PINKERTON                         And there are some towns in                         Missouri where James and his men can                         walk openly, as heroes.                                     PARKER                         How can that be?                                     PINKERTON                         They donate money to farmers, to                         churches. Rumor has it they gave the                         sharecroppers of Maddox so much                         money they were able to build a                         school.                                     RAINS                         With my money!                                     PARKER                         We should go burn that school to                         the ground, sir!                                     PINKERTON                              (dryly)                         Yes, that's the way to win the                         locals back to our side.                                     RAINS                         I demand action.                                     PINKERTON                         No, you demand results. They are                         not the same thing. And if you want                         results, you will let me do my job                         as I see fit. Unless of course,                              (jerking his head at                              Parker)                         You want this fool to saddle up and                         take another run at it?                                     RAINS                         Can't you tell me anything?                                     PINKERTON                         It's going to be a long spring.               MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS               -- THE GANG RIDES ALONGSIDE A PAYROLL COACH, The COACH is               marked with the ""Rock Northern Railroad"" logo.               Suddenly Pinkerton guards leap up from hiding places in the               coach and start firing! The gang fires back dropping two of               the men.               BANK WINDOW               Old ""Wanted"" posters are replaced by a new set.               THE COACH IS STOPPED               Jesse and Frank are pulling the payroll off as the rest of               the Gang keeps their guns on the remaining Pinkertons. Two               dead Pinkertons lie on the ground.                                     JESSE                         See, that's a shame. If people                         would just hand over the money and                         not shoot at us --               Loni looks at something in his hand.                                     BOB                         What's that?                                     LONI                         Lucky Rabbit's foot. Took it off                         that dead fella over there.                                     BOB                         I don't think that one's working,                         Loni.               Loni pockets the charm.               -- JESSE, FRANK, AND THE YOUNGER BROTHERS Sit heads bowed               in a small country church as the collection plate is passed.               Jesse drops in a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces.               -- A GROUP OF BOYS SWARM AROUND JESSE,               Getting him to autograph his ""WANTED! $10,000 REWARD DEAD               OR ALIVE!"" Poster. The Gang is all there, admiring the new               posters. The likenesses are remarkable -- except for Bob's.               It still looks nothing like him. And we can see Cole is not               pleased at all the attention Jesse's getting.               -- PINKERTON IN THE BOARD ROOM WITH HIS MAP,               Directing his lieutenants on how to cover the territory.               -- THE GANG CAROUSING IN A SALOON.               Jesse is off to one side, writing a letter on fancy               stationery. Frank is coaching him.               AT THE MIMMS HOME,               Doc Mimms hands Zee the envelope we just saw Jesse working               with. Zee takes the envelope and tosses it into the burning               fireplace.               INT. WHITTLY BANK - DAY               Jesse, Cole, Frank, and Bob are in the middle of a               stick-up. All the BANK PATRONS have their hands up.                                     JESSE                         Okay, folks, I think we know how                         this is going to go...                                     BOB                         One false move and I'll blow your                         heads off!               Jesse, Frank, and Cole look at Bob.                                     JESSE                         Beg pardon?                                     BOB                         You heard me, Jesse. You know how                         crazy I get!               Jesse and Cole turn to the HEAD TELLER.                                     JESSE                         'Scuse us.

COLE                         We got a problem here, brother?                                     BOB                              (low)                         Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little                         left out.                                     JESSE                              (sighing)                         This is about the ""Wanted!""                         Posters, isn't it.                                     BOB                         Yes. I am obviously not standing                         out in people's minds at the                         robberies.                                     COLE                              (to Jesse)                         This is your fault for hogging all                         the publicity.                                     JESSE                         Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob                         is an important part of the gang.               Frank arrives.                                     FRANK                         Gents, we are in the middle of                         something here.                                     JESSE                         Bob's upset.                                     FRANK                         The posters?

Frank, Jesse, and Cole exchange looks. They turn back to               the now puzzled crowd.                                     FRANK                         Pardon the delay, folks, but we had                         to get Mad Bob Younger under control!                                     JESSE                         Bob here'll kill a man for                         sneezing, and he's the best shot in                         the gang.

FRANK                         Now, we would like to get back to                         the robbery.                                     HEAD TELLER                         Of course.               The Head Teller starts filling a saddlebag with money. Bob               glares at a few people, then nods at Jesse. Jesse winks back.

At one table, Loni Packwood lays               down his poker hand. As the other players moan, he rakes in               the pot.                                     CLELL                         Damn, Loni, you're lucky.                                     LONI                         Luckiest man in the West, now that                         I'm riding with Jesse James!               He raises his lucky rabbit's foot in toast to Jesse, who is               at the bar nursing a bottle of whisky with Frank.               ANGLE ON               Jesse and Frank at the bar.                                     JESSE                         This has been a good year.                                     FRANK                         Jesse, we're outlaws.                                     JESSE                         And we're good at it.

JESSE                         You've killed your fair share of                         men.                                     FRANK                         If I could go back to farming --                                     JESSE                         That's a lie. You could've bought a                         dozen farms with the money we've                         stolen.                                     FRANK                         I can't quit and leave you alone. I                         can't quit until you quit. Ma                         would've wanted it that way.                                     JESSE                         We're doing this for Ma.                                     FRANK                         Maybe it started out that way. But                         now...                                     JESSE                         What do you want me to say, Frank?                         I was killing men when I was                         fifteen. I like getting shot at. I                         like riding out of town with a posse                         at my back. This is a helluva better                         life than farming.                                     FRANK                         A better life than the one you                         could have had with Zee?               Jesse HURLS the whisky bottle against the wall. At the               CRASH the saloon falls silent. Every eye turns to the James               boys. Frank stands up.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         I'll bet you every dollar we've                         stolen that she hasn't read a single                         one of the letters you've sent her.               Jesse is boiling. His hand twitches.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         You going to throw down on me,                         Jesse?               Jesse's jaw is grinding.                                     JESSE                         Don't do this, Frank. You know I                         love you.               Frank nods, embraces his brother. The saloon noise STARTS               UP again. Frank steps away.                                     FRANK                         We're drunk.                                     JESSE                         Oh yeah.                                     FRANK                         Just do me a favor. Think about                         what this is costing everybody. Not                         just the railroad.               Jesse nods and Frank EXITS. Jim Younger, also drunk, steps               up.                                     JIM                         You okay, Jesse?                                     JESSE                         Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky?                         You're too young to be drinking                         whisky.                                     JIM                         Not too young to shoot a man, not                         to young to drink.                                     JESSE                              (jolted)                         I guess so.                                     JIM                         I was always jealous Web Mimms got                         to go off and fight with you and                         Cole. Now it's my turn.               Jesse takes this in silently.                                     JESSE                         Jim, you been with a girl yet?                                     JIM                         Tonight? Why, I'm just getting                         ready to turn on the Younger charm.               Jesse raises an eyebrow.                                     JIM  (CONT'D)                         Well, not exactly.                                     JESSE                         You been with a girl ever?                                     JIM                              (insulted)                         Hell yeah! I been with...                              (sighs)                         Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't                         want to get one of these paid                         ladies, you know?                                     JESSE                         I think so.                                     JIM                         You and Frank and Cole, and even                         Bob, get all these girls because                         you're good looking and famous. You                         don't have to pay. They just look at                         me like I'm the baby brother.                              (then)                         Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?                                     JESSE                         I swear.                                     JIM                              (whispering)                         Tell you something else.                              (belches)                         I can't drink that good neither.                         I'm going to go outside and throw up.                                     JESSE                         You do that.               Jim stumbles away and OUT THE DOOR. We hear him THROWING UP               ENERGETICALLY a moment later. Jesse thinks for a moment,               beckons over the bartender.               INT. SALOON - A FEW MINUTES LATER               Jim stumbles back in. A pretty young woman, LYLA,               approaches him.                                     LYLA                         Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger?               Jim pulls himself together.                                     JIM                         Why, yeah.                                     LYLA                         I hope you don't mind, Jesse James                         told me your name.                                     JIM                              (crestfallen)                         Oh, you were talking to Jesse.                                     LYLA                         Yes, but just so I could find out                         who you were.               Jim brightens.                                     JIM                         Really?                                     LYLA                         I hope I'm not being too forward.                                     JIM                         Not at all.                                     LYLA                         I just though you were awful cute.                                     JIM                         Thank you, Miss -- ?                                     LYLA                         Lyla Devereux.                                     JIM                         Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you                         a drink?                                     LYLA                         Could we go upstairs and talk? It's                         so loud down here.                                     JIM                              (trying to stay                              smooth)                         Why don't we get a bottle of sherry                         to sip while we talk?                                     LYLA                         That is so gentlemanly of you.               As they head to the bar, WE SEE Jesse slide some money to               the bartender.                                     JIM                              (crossing)                         Devereux. My brother Cole dated a                         European girl once.

CONFERENCE ROOM               Parker is leading Rains into the room. Rains SNAPS SHUT his               ever-present Pocketwatch.                                     PARKER                         The final route for the railroad is                         complete.                                     RAINS                         I look forward to seeing it.               A group of RAILROAD MEN wait around, wearing forced smiles.               Parker shows Rains the map.               REVEAL the wall-sized map of the United States. The plainly               marked RAIL LINE extends due west from New York, through               Philadelphia, a straight shot west --               -- until it reaches Missouri, where it takes a painfully               obvious swing in a large semi-circle south of the state,               then swings up again and continues due west.               Rains takes this in. Parker and the railroad men are trying               to look casual.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)                         Parker.                                     PARKER                         Sir?

Suddenly, viciously, Rains GRABS PARKER BY THE NECK and               SLAMS his face against the map.                                     RAINS                              (calmly)                         That.                                     PARKER                              (strangled)                         Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.               Rains drops Parker, who slides to the floor stunned. He               turns to JENKINS, who is suddenly in an open area cleared by               the retreating railroad men.                                     JENKINS                         Sir.                                     RAINS                         Jenkins.

JENKINS                         It's cheaper to go around Jesse                         James, sir. Even with the detour and                         the extra track. It's just cheaper.               Rains turns to look at the map.                                     RAINS                         So he's won.                                     PINKERTON (O.S.) (O.S.)

They always pull                         a job right before they return,                         probably to have extra money to give                         family and friends.

HIS POV reveals the address: ""Miss Zerelda Mimms, Liberty,               Missouri.""               BACK TO SHOT               as Jesse reaches up to the street lantern and lights the               envelope on fire. He drops it to the ground and watches it               smolder.               Bob Younger walks up, holding a ""Wanted"" poster.                                     BOB                         Finally.               Jesse looks, grins.

BOB                         He's planning a job.                                     JESSE                         What?                                     BOB                         Listen, he's my brother and I don't                         want to start trouble...                                     JESSE                         Tell me.               INT. SALOON - GAMBLING ROOM               Back in a semiprivate card room, Cole is talking to the               rest of the Gang.                                     COLE                         It'll be the biggest score yet.                                     JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         What will be?               Jesse and Frank step from the shadows. Cole tosses them a               newspaper.                                     COLE                         Hyperion Bank, two day's ride from                         Liberty. They've got a hundred                         thousand dollars in railroad money                         just sitting there.               Jesse tosses the paper aside.                                     JESSE                         Smells funny, it being mentioned in                         the paper.                                     COLE                         If you'd read about it first, you'd                         have no problems.                                     JESSE                         What are you saying?                                     COLE                         I've robbed just as many banks as                         you have! I know this town, and I                         know this bank, and I say it's an                         easy job.                                     JESSE                         You're forgetting who's in charge --                                     FRANK                              (calming him)                         Jesse.                                     COLE                         Oh, you're in charge? We ain't                         partners any more, Jesse? You tell                         Cole Younger where and when to ride?                                     FRANK                         Cole, he didn't mean that.                                     JESSE                         You taking sides against me, now,                         Frank?                                     FRANK                         No, I --                                     COLE                         So being with me is being against                         you? Well, we don't want to do that!                         None of us poor idiots want to go up                         against the famous Jesse James,                         greatest outlaw who ever lived!               Jesse glares at Cole. The Gang is murmuring amongst               themselves.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         That's what the newspapers say.                         Weren't for Jesse James, this gang                         wouldn't be able to find a goat's                         ass with a stick.                                     BOB                         What?               Clell Miller leans forward.                                     CLELL                         You have got mighty full of                         yourself lately, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         You think so. You all do?                              (to Frank)                         You?               Frank hesitates a half-second too long.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (spitting)                         Beautiful.                                     COLE                         Now the one time one of us comes up                         with an idea --                                     JESSE                         A bad idea.                                     COLE                         I got us through the War all right.                                     JESSE                         And almost got hanged in peacetime.                                     COLE                         That's it.               Cole LUNGES for Jesse, and in a flash they're               streetfighting, all elbows and knees and rib punches,               GRUNTING and SWEARING. Frank and Bob try to break it up, but               it's too fierce.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Let them fight it out. The poison                         needs to leave the wound, to heal.               Jesse lands a ROUNDHOUSE, knocking Cole away. Cole goes for               his gun, and in a blur they've both DRAWN and stand facing               each other with cocked six-guns. The Gang watches in stunned               silence.                                     BOB                         This is healing?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Sometimes a wound will kill.                                     BOB                         Now you tell us.                                     FRANK                              (edging in)                         Boys, we don't want this.               Neither Jesse nor Cole will back down. They circle, still               keeping their guns up.                                     COLE                              (gritted teeth)                         I'm the better soldier, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         And I'm the better outlaw.               Jim steps up.                                     JIM                         And you both hate the railroad.                         That's what's important. We do this                         job, and Thaddeus Rains won't dare                         come West again.               Jesse's gaze slides to Jim.                                     JESSE                         What about that Rock Island bastard?                                     JIM                         It's his money.  He's putting up                         the payroll out of his own fortune.                         You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains,                         don't you Jesse?               Jesse and Cole stare at each other again.                                     JESSE                         Still smells fishy.                                     COLE                         Then let me run the show, General                         Lee.               Jesse thumbs down the hammer of his Colt. Cole does the               same. The entire Gang breathes out as one.                                     JESSE                         Fine. We hit this bank.                                     COLE                         You'll be smiling once you've got                         all that money to spend, cousin.                              (to Gang)                         Cole Younger's going to make                         everybody rich!               The Gang CHEERS. Frank watches Jesse cross to the WINDOW               and sag against it, exhausted.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. HYPERION BANK - DAY               The James Gang rides up to the bank. A WATER TOWER can be               seen behind the building opposite the bank.               Jesse, Cole and Frank dismount and move swiftly to the bank               doors. Comanche Tom, Jim Younger, Clell Miller and Loni               Packwood dismount and take defensive positions. The few               other Gang members stay on their horses, looking sharp.               ANGLE ON               Cole holds up at the door, produces his shotgun. Frank and               Jesse draw six guns. On Cole's lead, they KICK OPEN THE               DOORS AND RUSH IN.               INT. HYPERION BANK               Cole and the James brothers stride in.                                     COLE                         Nobody move! This is a robbery!               The dozen or so farmers and tellers raise their hands.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Loni is whistling away, rubbing his lucky rabbit's foot. He               squints up at the sun, turns, then stops. He slowly turns               back...               HIS POV reveals a dozen men APPEARING at the edge of the               opposite rooftop, aiming rifles...               Loni lets his rabbit's foot drop...               The FIRST GUNSHOTS PLOW INTO LONI! As he falls back, we see               the rabbit's foot hit the dusty ground...               The Gang leaps for cover as a HAIL OF BULLETS begins to               tear up the bank face around them.               INT. HYPERION BANK Jesse, Frank and Cole whirl to face the               door.                                     COLE                         What the --               JESSE'S POV in a mirror by the door reveals all twelve of               the men in the bank drawing guns, shotguns, one rifle --               Jesse shoves Cole and Frank down. He KICKS a stool at the               man with the rifle, dives right and ROLLS across a big oak               desk. The men begin to FIRE. As BULLETS PING around him,               Jesse FIRES from between his legs as he rolls across the               desk. The assassins start to drop.               Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the               manager's area from the bank floor. In one smooth move he's               up and RUNNING ALONG THE RAILING, defying gravity, drawing               his shoulder Colts and shooting...               The gunmen are crossing into each other's line of fire,               Jesse's movement confusing them. Jesse's killed another               five, only four left, but he's out of railing and --               CRASH! Through a teller's cage, disappearing behind the               counter. The gunmen turn and BLAST the wooden counter, some               screaming in panic.  CLICKS are heard as hammers fall on               empty magazines.               The gunmen stare at where Jesse disappeared, panting               heavily.               CLICK.               They forgot about Cole and Frank.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               The Gang is scrambling for cover. Loni's body lies in the               street, his rabbit's foot lying in a pool of his blood. The               Gang is returning fire, hiding behind water troughs, dead               horses, barely staying alive. The ROAR OF GUNFIRE is               deafening.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Head for the end of the street!                                     JIM                         Look!               At both ends of the street, WAGONS ROLL into position, each               manned by two armed Pinkertons. The Gang is trapped.               INT. HYPERION BANK               A shot of the open, empty VAULT.                                     COLE                         Dammit!                                     JESSE (O.S.)

As the last one steps in, Jesse SLAMS the door               closed. WE HEAR MORE GUNFIRE. Frank runs in from the back of               the bank.                                     FRANK                         Another dozen out back.                                     COLE                         They gonna rush us?

Jesse pulls back inside.               INT. HYPERION BANK               Frank and Cole are shooting through the windows.

FRANK                         Got any ideas, little brother?               Jesse thinks, then smiles.

He rolls to a stop               next to one of the horses, grabs a saddlebag, then -- to the               disbelief of the Gang -- he pivots and CRASHES right back               into the Bank!               INT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse stumbles to his feet, yanks open the bag. Sticks of               dynamite tumble out.

HYPERION BANK               WE PAN across the trapped Gang, still under fire, to the               front of the next door Saloon, and then WE ZIP               INT. SALOON               Where wary patrons have taken cover from the gunfire.               Suddenly --               BOOOM! One wall EXPLODES into dust! In the hole we see the               interior of the Bank and --               Jesse James running through, already readying another stick               of dynamite --               EXT. ROOFTOP               Where the Pinkerton gunmen are shooting at the Gang. Some               of the gunmen look curiously as the windows to the building               two doors down from the bank BLOW OUT.               EXT. STREET               As the two Pinkerton detectives at the wagon barricade turn               in shock as Jesse James LEAPS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR of a               building he can't possibly be in, lands on the wagon, rolls               off and DASHES INTO a blacksmith shop across the street.               They suddenly notice a HISS. They stand, look in the wagon.               Jesse left a burning stick of dynamite in the wagon.               ANGLE ON               the wagon EXPLODING into matchsticks.               INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP               The blacksmith is gone, but there's a fire in the FORGE.               Jesse leaps and KICKS OVER the forge --               ANGLE ON               The white-hot coals IGNITING everything.               EXT. ROOFTOP               The Pinkertons firing on the gang notice SMOKE rising from               below them. They look down ...               REVEAL bellowing FLAMES and SMOKE enveloping the entire row               of buildings below them.               BACK TO               The roof as a PINKERTON COMMANDER runs to ledge and looks               at the rising flames himself.               A HUGE EXPLOSION is heard O.C. A large SHADOW creeps over               the snipers. They turn and look up --               -- at the Water Tower TOPPLING towards them!               The Pinkertons dive out of the way as the tower SMASHES               onto the roof, unleashing a TIDAL WAVE of water!               EXT. STREET               UPSHOT of the sniper's ledge as the Pinkertons leap off,               followed by a WALL OF WATER --               WIDEN to see the water POURING into the building from above               --               Cowboys FLY out the windows, followed by TORRENTS of water               --               One Pinkerton SWEPT UP and carried off the roof, BOUNCES               off a second floor balcony and lands in a puddle on the dirt               street below.               FOLLOW the water rushing across the dirt street to the feet               of --               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Jim, Tom and the Gang staring in disbelief at the total               destruction Jesse has wrought.               EXT. STREET               Jesse rides out from a stable leading a team of horses. He               reaches the bank.                                     JESSE                         No time to gawk, boys, we got                         somewhere else to be!               Frank and Cole rush out from the bank. The Gang leaps onto               the horses and put the spurs to them hard.               ANGLE ON               the Gang galloping past the shattered wagon barricade,               heading for the edge of town.               Pinkerton riflemen run out of the bank and from behind the               other barricade. One SHARPSHOOTER with a rifle drops to one               knee, lines up...               HIS POV shows Jesse in his sights. He tightens on the               trigger, and just as he pulls --               -- Jim Younger rides into the line of fire! With a CRACK               the bullet hits Jim square in the back. He slumps forward on               his horse. Comanche Tom leaps from his horse onto Jim's and               urges it on.               ANGLE ON               The James Gang disappearing past the edge of town. The               Pinkertons stand stunned amongst the ruin of their ambush.               Alan Pinkerton himself walks up, shaking his head.               EXT. HILL COUNTRY - EVENING               The Gang rides up onto a wooded hill where huge rocks jut               from the earth. They all dismount, Jesse and Cole supporting               Jim's limp form as they pull him from the saddle. Jim is               drenched in blood.                                     JESSE                         Okay, you're gonna rest here.                                     COLE                         Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in                         Liberty!                                     CLELL                         That's a long ride, Cole. We won't                         be back 'til morning.                                     JESSE                         Then you better get going!               Cole and Jesse are united again in their grief over Jim.                                     COLE                         Bob, rip up some bandages.                                     JESSE                         Pass me some whisky.               Jim's eyes flutter open for the first time.                                     JIM                         ... too young for whisky...                                     JESSE                         This time we'll make an exception.                                     JIM                         Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My                         girl, you know, from that time...                                     JESSE                         You're gonna tell her when you're                         resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.                                     COLE                         Jim, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.                                     JIM                         Best time of my life.                              (weakly)                         I was famous, y'know...               Jim dies. Cole cradles the body, begins rocking. Comanche               Tom puts a hand on Bob's shoulder as Bob slumps against a               rock.               Jesse stands, walks away heavily.               EXT. HILLTOP - A WHILE LATER               Sunset is heavy in the sky. Jesse stares off at it. His               anguish is palpable. Frank comes over.                                     JESSE                         Shoulda learned with Web. Made it                         look fun, made it look like an                         adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.                                     FRANK                         Jim was old enough...                                     JESSE                              (snorts)                         He was a boy riding with the most                         famous outlaws in the West. How was                         he supposed to say no to that?                                     FRANK                         Railroad burned him out too. You                         couldn't have stopped him.                                     JESSE                         You're a piss-poor liar for the                         smartest man I know.                                     FRANK                         Yeah.                                     JESSE                         A war against the railroad. What                         the hell were we thinking?                                     FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a good idea                         at the time.               Jesse remembers the first time Frank said that. He crosses               BACK TO               the Gang.               ANGLE ON               the Gang -- what's left of them -- waiting by the horses.               The unspoken knowledge of whose fault this is hangs in the               air.               Cole is covered in Jim's blood.                                     COLE                         We'll make them pay for this.                                     JESSE                         I'm out.                                     COLE                         WHAT?! We follow you for a year,                         and now that our blood's been                         spilled, you're gonna quit?!                                     JESSE                         Who's next? You? Me? Bob?               Cole can't answer.                                     CLELL                         We can't exactly go back to our                         lives, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         I'm not telling you what to do. You                         want to keep on following Cole, fine                         by me.                                     BOB                         Frank?               Frank nods. He's leaving too.                                     COLE                         Go ahead. Ride on. But don't come                         back when you figure out you can't                         farm with a six-gun.               Bob embraces Frank. Jesse goes to shake hands with Cole,               but the guilt and rage make his once-best friend               unapproachable. Jesse smiles sadly and walks away.               EXT. MIMMS HOME - EARLY MORNING               Zee is letting a dog out. She looks up, freezes. Entranced,               she walks out onto the porch.               ANGLE ON               A figure appearing out of the early morning fog. It's               Jesse, riding slow. He reins his horse in at the porch,               dismounts. He stands staring at Zee.                                     JESSE                         Zee.                                     ZEE                         Jesse. What are you thinking? There                         are bounty hunters and lawmen all                         over this county!                                     JESSE                         I had to see you. I'm getting                         married.               Zee is shocked. Jesse looks serious.                                     ZEE                         I don't understand.                                     JESSE                         She's the most wonderful woman in                         the world. Can't get her out of my                         mind.                                     ZEE                         That's... wonderful. It's just... I                         thought...                                     JESSE                         She's beautiful. Smart. And has the                         biggest... buck teeth in all of                         Missouri.               It takes Zee a second. Before she can process it all, Jesse               drops to one knee.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live                         in my home and in my heart.               Zee takes the hat off Jesse's head, tosses it into the yard               and smiles. Jesse stands up and they kiss.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. HORSE DRAWN TAXI - DAY               Victorian wooden houses with tin roofs and palm trees line               the street.               Jesse and Zee ride in the back of the open carriage. They               can't take their eyes off each other.                                     ZEE                         I would never have imagined us in a                         place like this.                                     JESSE                         That's why I picked it. We can                         start a whole new life down here.                                     ZEE                         Are you going to be happy here, Mr.                         James? Without all that excitement?                                     JESSE                         I've got you. You keep me busy. I                         figure we'll get over to the                         hotel... get checked in, cleaned                         up... then I'd like to do something                         I've been thinking about for a long                         time.                                     ZEE                         Now wait a minute. There are                         certain things that have to wait                         until after the wedding.               Jesse leans forward to the DRIVER.                                     JESSE                         Driver, change of plans. Take us to                         the nearest church.                                     DRIVER                         What religion?                                     JESSE                         Whichever one has God in it,                         that'll do fine.               INT. CHURCH RECTORY - DAY               A PASTOR sits at his desk while Jesse finishes filling out               a marriage license.                                     PASTOR                         This is unusual. Most of our                         marriages are members of the                         congregation.                                     JESSE                         You don't think God'll mind, do you?               Jesse slides him two twenties with the license.

Comanche Tom speaks, but keeps his eyes on               Bob.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         My people know that when a brother                         kills a brother, a great curse comes                         down on that man, and when he dies                         he walks the desert as a dark                         spirit. I like Bob too much to let                         that happen.

Cole's thoughts are his own.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT.

They come easily,               despite Jesse being chained up like the Frankenstein monster.               The DOOR OPENS. Jesse looks up in mid-push-up. Alan               Pinkerton is looking down at him.               Jesse moves to the bed. Pinkerton, flanked by two guards,               ENTERS. He sits on a stool provided by one of the guards.                                     PINKERTON                         We're moving you tomorrow.

PINKERTON                         That's the idea.               Pinkerton produces two cigars, presenting one to Jesse.                                     JESSE                         Did you order our houses burned                         down?                                     PINKERTON                         Not that day. I am guilty of many                         things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus                         Rains and Parker, that day.               Jesse takes the cigar, and Pinkerton lights both. They puff               for a moment.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                              (tapping bad leg)                         Was this you, by the way?               Jesse exposes his scar.                                     JESSE                         You almost ended my career before                         it began.                                     PINKERTON                         Pity.               Pause.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         How did you spot the ambush in                         Torrell?                                     JESSE                         Last February?                                     PINKERTON                         Mmm.                                     JESSE                         You had all those cattle there, so                         I'd think the extra men were in town                         from the cattle drive?                                     PINKERTON                         Yes?                                     JESSE                         The cows had a brand from a farm                         just five miles out of town.                                     PINKERTON                         Damn.               Pause.                                     JESSE                         Almost got me in Billings. I saw                         you there, shooting at me.                                     PINKERTON                         I went myself to oversee the                         operation. Didn't help much.                                     JESSE                         No, that one was close. A couple                         fellas quit after that one.                                     PINKERTON                         Oh. That's nice to know.                              (then)                         We're going to hang you, you know.                                     JESSE                         I figured.                                     PINKERTON                         Was it worth it?                                     JESSE                         Should have just killed Thaddeus                         Rains and been done with it.                                     PINKERTON                         That's what I would have done.                                     JESSE                         I'm not hanged yet.                                     PINKERTON                              (shaking his head)                         You cocky little bastard.                                     JESSE                         Ahh, you'll miss me.                                     PINKERTON                         No, I'll hang you.                              (then)                         But I may miss you just a bit.               As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and discuss the past year...               EXT. TRAINYARD               Two guards are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons,               toward a prison car at the end of a waiting train.               Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and Parker walk up.                                     RAINS                         This is him.                                     PARKER                         I remember you.                                     JESSE                         You're Parker. I remember you, too.                         You killed my Ma.               Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear --                                     PARKER                         How did you know?                                     RAINS                         Not such a menace now, is he,                         Pinkerton?                                     PINKERTON                         If you feel that way, I could                         always take off the irons.               Rains glares at Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse.                                     RAINS                         You stole thousands. You cost me                         tens of millions of dollars, months                         of lost construction. I wish I could                         hang you every single morning for a                         century.               Rains checks his Pocketwatch, spots Jesse eyeing it.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)                         You like that? Solid gold, my                         father had it made when he started                         this railroad. He gave it to me when                         I took over, I'll give it to my son                         when he runs this company, and he'll                         give it to his son -- The right type                         of men will always run this country,                         Jesse James, and little men like you                         will always suffer. You have stopped                         nothing.                                     JESSE                         Made you think twice about burning                         folks' homes down now, didn't I?               Jesse winks.               With that Parker reaches back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse.               Rains gloats as Jesse gets his breath back.                                     RAINS                         We'll speak again in Washington,                         you insect.                                     JESSE                         You're coming on the same train?               Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his               head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several               cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed               with Pinkerton detectives.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Well, tell you what. I'm going to                         have to pay you a visit.                                     RAINS                         Big words.                                     JESSE                         It's a promise.               Everyone is a little shaken by the steel in Jesse's voice.               The guards DRAG JESSE OFF.               INT. PRISON CAR               The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE. Pinkerton               enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in total in               the car.                                     PINKERTON                         Hook him up.               The Burly Detective brings Jesse's arms above his head. He               loops Jesse's chain over a rail that runs the length of the               car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down the car, Jesse's               hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just barely sit               down.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         Now the guns.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         I don't like it. We can handle him.                                     PINKERTON                         In the ten seconds we have been in                         this car, I have seen you get close                         enough for Jesse James to grab your                         guns at least three times. And I                         assure you, if he gets his hands on                         one of your guns, you are all, and I                         mean all dead men.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         He's chained up.                                     PINKERTON                         I'll put that on your tombstone.                         The guns.               Grumbling, the detectives deposit their pistols in a box               near the front of the car. Pinkerton walks out.               The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waistband.               ANGLE ON               Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pinkerton guards. The train               LURCHES, and they're off.               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY               The prison train highballs through the wooded, rolling               hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective car,               then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and               then the prison car.               INT. PRISON CAR               Five guards are playing poker. Five others are standing               along the length of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box               waaay down the other end of the car.               Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train is going               downhill.                                     JESSE                         Hey, fatty.               The Burly Detective looks up.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         What?                                     JESSE                         You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here                         piggy piggy!               The detectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly               Detective moves right up on him.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         What you sayin' boy?                                     JESSE                         I think I recognize you.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         How?                                     JESSE                         I think I saw you leavin' by the                         front door just as I was coming in                         the back.               The other detectives try to hide grins.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         You shut up now, boy.                                     JESSE                         No, really. You're wife said she                         needed some help, seeing as you were                         so fat you couldn't find your --               Burly Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and               grins.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Yeah, she said you did that to her                         too.               Burly draws, points the gun right at Jesse's face. The               other detectives GASP. Jesse stares down the barrel, then               raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and               terrifying.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Y'know, I could do this without the                         gun, but it just makes things easier.               SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES,               missing Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a               mongoose.               Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun               drops right into Jesse's hands --               The guards are running for the gun box --               Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF from               the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the               detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun,               blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's               ceiling strut, and then KICKS at the roof.               The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropping Jesse to the floor. In a               blur he's up, reaching into the gun box. He tosses one gun               INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of another.               Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top               of him and nobody's that fast --               Jesse drops the spent gun, CATCHES the other gun in the               opposite hand and FANS THAT HAMMER all in a single breath!               As the smoke clears, the last of the detectives falls with               a THUD.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a               gunbelt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still               holding the chain from his restraints. Now that they're no               longer wrapped around Jesse, we see they're at least a few               yards long.               INT. THIRD TROOP CAR               Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds from on top of the               car.               EXT. TRAIN               And Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and --               CLANK as the chains -- fastened to the roof -- go taut and               Jesse is at window level and he's FIRING AND FIRING into the               car!               INT. THIRD TROOP CAR               Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a               bead on Jesse because --               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse is running along the side of the car, supported by               the chain! Still shooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and               is on the roof again.               ANGLE ON               one Detective, barely alive, stumbling through the door,               opening the door to the next               INT. SECOND TROOP CAR               The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into               the doorway.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse looks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming               out of the doorway.                                     JESSE                         Shit.               But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the               EXT. SECOND TROOP CAR               Jesse's running and the Pinkertons start SHOOTING THROUGH               the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched, almost to the               CLUB CAR...               INT. CLUB CAR               Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains               look around.                                     RAINS                         What the hell is that sound?                                     PINKERTON                         Vengeance.               INT. FIRST TROOP CAR               Pinkerton bursts in. The men snap to.                                     PINKERTON                         Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!               EXT. CLUB CAR               Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as               detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other               detectives climbing up behind him. He's trapped.               BUT WE HEAR A LOW WHISTLE AND               EXT. TRAIN ENGINE               The engine EXPLODES! Sparks fly as the twisted engine               GRINDS onto the tracks!               EXT. TRAIN               The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some               detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the               roof of the Club Car --                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               CLOSE ON a smoking CANNON sitting on the tracks. WIDEN TO               REVEAL Frank and Cole on horseback shading their eyes. Zee               is daintily blowing out a fuse lighter.                                     FRANK                         Nice shot.                                     ZEE                         Thank you. Now go get my husband.               The two men start to gallop toward the train.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse, Pinkerton, and the detectives look down the track               and see...               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods ride               Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect               formation. The four THUNDER toward the train.               INT. CLUB CAR               Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out               the window.                                     PARKER                         There's only four of them...                                     PINKERTON                         Move you fools!               He grabs the two businessmen and heads them to the rear of               the train.               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               Frank draws a gun and FIRES.               EXT. WOODS               TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the               Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the               train cars as the riders strafe the train.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the               window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back               along the top of the train.               EXT. PRISON CAR               Pinkerton, Rains and Parker tumble out of the door and run               for the woods.               Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton!               They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his               gunbelt.               Empty.               With almost a resigned sigh, he looks up. Jesse's pointing               the gun at Pinkerton's head.                                     PINKERTON                         Do it.               Jesse FIRES.               ANGLE ON               Pinkerton, stunned to realize he's still alive. He turns to               see Parker, fall to the ground, his own gun half-drawn,               Jesse turns the gun on Rains.                                     JESSE                         That was for my Ma. Now this is for                         everybody else.                                     PINKERTON                         He's too important, James.  They'll                         set the army on you. You and your                         wife.               Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension               building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says:                                     JESSE                         That is a nice watch you got there.               Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't               broken.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I tell you what, I'll buy that                         watch from you, for the fair market                         price approved by the Department of                         the Interior: one dollar.               Rains hesitates. Jesse thumbs the hammer back                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         If I were you, I'd sell. After                         this, the price goes...down.               Rains tosses the Watch to Jesse as Jesse simultaneously               FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free hand. Jesse holds up               the Watch.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Now every time you go to look at                         this watch and it's not there,                         you'll remember: You can be stopped.                         Pass that down to your son, instead.               Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun. Rains               falls to his knees, numb from the tension.               Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it               to him. Pinkerton holds him for a second.                                     PINKERTON                              (low)                         Tennessee.               Jesse doesn't understand.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         The railroad has no business in                         Tennessee. Therefore I have no                         interest in the state of Tennessee.                                     JESSE                         Thanks.                                     PINKERTON                         I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse                         James. But chasing you takes up too                         much of my time.                                     JESSE                         Fair enough.               Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they               RIDE OFF with Frank.               We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rains, and               revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train.               EXT. HILLSIDE FIELDS - DAY               Most of the Gang is mounted. Frank, Cole and Bob are               standing there, watching.               ANGLE ON               Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse.                                     ZEE                         You get arrested again, I'll kill                         you.                                     JESSE                         Yes ma'am.                                     ZEE                         I can't believe I had to blow up a                         train for you.                                     JESSE                         You are a hell of a woman.                                     ZEE                         Don't swear.                                     JESSE                         Yes ma'am.               They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse, gets one               of Cole's BEAR HUGS.                                     COLE                         Missed you, cousin.                                     JESSE                         Missed you too, cousin.               Jesse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite               figure out what's going on.                                     COLE                         You know, you gettin' caught, right                         after leaving us, some people                         thought --                                     JESSE                         Pff. All we been through, the                         thought never crossed my mind.               The two clasp hands.                                     BOB                         Things changed when you quit the                         gang. For example, I'm now the one                         who says ""Let's ride.""                                     COLE                         He's not bad at it.                                     BOB                         It's tougher than it looks.                                     JESSE                         Where'd you get all these riders?                                     COLE                         We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out                         your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.                                     BOB                         So what's the plan?               Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank.                                     JESSE                         I think my wife and I might go down                         Tennessee way, buy a farm.                              (pause)                         Goodbye, boys.               The Youngers smile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers               SADDLE UP, Comanche Tom leans down from the saddle and               shakes Jesse's hand.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You stay out of trouble, Jesse.                         Nobody has as much luck as you used                         up today.               ANGLE ON               Jesse getting back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands               there and watches them.                                     FRANK                         I'll meet you down there in a few                         weeks.                                     JESSE                         See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate                         the distraction back there.                                     FRANK                         Hell, they hardly even noticed us.               Jesse and Frank grin.                                     BOB                         Let's ride!               Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RIDE OFF, the GANG               with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite direction.               Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly:                                     ZEE                         Tennessee?                                     JESSE                         I'll explain on the way.               Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind               him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and               now he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and...               EXT. HILLSIDE NEAR LIBERTY - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER               ...we COMPLETE THE CIRCLE and see young Frank James is now               an older FRANK JAMES. Still lean, a few wrinkles, a little               grey in the hair, dressed in expensive turn-of-the-century               western clothes. A young man who looks remarkably like               Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting patiently. The               two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri, which               is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is               disappearing under roads and telegraph wire.                                     JIMMY                         Y'know, Uncle Frank...                                     FRANK                         Yeah, Jimmy?                                     JIMMY                              (genially chiding)                         ...every time you tell that story,                         you stop there. That's not how it                         ended. I was five when my dad got                         shot.                                     FRANK                         I know. But that's how it should                         have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding                         off into a new life, growing old                         together, happy.               They start to walk back to the edge of town.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Allow a man his version of the                         past. When you get to be my age,                         you've got enough painful memories,                         you're allowed to soften a few of                         the edges up.                                     JIMMY                         Sounds like he was a hell of a man.                                     FRANK                              (chuckling)                         That he was.                                     JIMMY                         They're making him a hero now.                                     FRANK                         Saved a lot of folk from the                         railroad.                                     JIMMY                         But he killed a lot of men, too.                                     FRANK                         Can't argue that.                                     JIMMY                         So what was he?                                     FRANK                         I think... he was just a real                         interestin' fella to have around.               Frank chuckles again at the memories, claps his hand on               Jimmy's shoulder.

We stay ON               THEIR BACKS as they continue talking.                                     JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Uncle Frank?                                     FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Yeah Jimmy?                                     JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)                         How much of that story is true?                                     FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Everything but the boring parts.

SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet               hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as               the REFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload               a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is               holding back, and the punches all find purchase in the               swelling faces of their opponent. The crowd rises to its               feet in appreciation of this rare level of competition in               the lower strata of the heavyweight division.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - COLDWATER CANYON - LOS ANGELES - SUNSET               Bobby drives Ricky home through the winding twists of LA's               landmark canyon. Both their faces are swollen, verging on               the grotesque. Bobby drives a black Special Edition 1979               Trans Am with the gold Firebird stenciled across the hood.               The car is not in great shape, but in its day ruled the               road. A Hawaiian mini warrior mask hangs from the rear view.               The T-top is out, and Ricky struggles to light his               cigarette in the wind. He finally ignites the whole book of               matches in frustration, lights up, then tosses it out.               It lands, still flaming, at the base of a 'No Smoking in               the Canyon' sign. They drive down the palm tree lined               stretch of road bordering Beverly Hills. They turn East on               Sunset Boulevard. The Strip lights are first flickering to               life.               EXT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - YUCCA CORRIDOR - NIGHT               The opening SCORE dies away as Ricky sits beside Bobby. The               neighborhood is awful. The light of the corner liquor store               and a menthol cigarette billboard make up for the broken               street lamps. Ricky smooths out his running suit and steals               an instinctive cautionary look, scanning all the blind spots               for predators. The swelling has now truly set in. He's a               mess.                                     RICKY                         Did Max mention anything about any                         jobs?                                     BOBBY                         What about boxing?                                     RICKY                         What about it?                                     BOBBY                         What are you saying?                                     RICKY                         You said if you didn't have a                         winning record after eleven fights,                         you'd talk to Max.                                     BOBBY                         So?                                     RICKY                         So, it was a draw.

JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               Bobby pulls up in front of the quaint Spanish Colonial               two-flat. He bounds up the stairs to the upper unit.               INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS               He lets himself in, searching for his girlfriend. The               apartment is Z-Gallery, with a few accents of Bobby's               HAWAIIANA.

Too               pretty. The pretty that makes a woman a full-time job.               What's worse is she's decked out like a whore. She's wearing               slutty lingerie covered by a bland terry cloth bathrobe. Her               ridiculously long legs are garnished with candy-apple porn               star sky high heels.  Bobby watches with cultivated patience               as she applies tasteless amounts of make-up from a Mac case               the size of a tackle box. She's in a hurry.

BOBBY                         They're not too classy to have tits                         rubbed in their face.               She rises and swaps her robe for a floor length overcoat.               God, is she hot.                                     JESS                         Stop. I love you.               She leans in for a kiss. He lets his anger melt.

The crowd can't believe their luck when they               see how hot she is. Bobby's heart sinks. He picks up her               coat and walks to the bar as the men wave bills at the love               of his life.               INT. BAR - HAVANA ROOM - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS               Bobby settles into a bar stool, watching the action from a               distance. WENDY, a slutty Pam Anderson pre-tit-removal               wannabe, is already bouncing her ass ghetto-style in a young               agent's face. The crowd gravitates to the new meat like a               pack of ravenous dingoes. A beautiful young BARTENDER with               her hair tied back drops a cocktail napkin in front of               Bobby. She sees his bruises.

Bobby downs his drink as he watches Jess give a HORNY GUY               in a suit a lap dance. He gets a little frisky, grabbing her               ass cheeks. Bobby begins to RISE. Jess circumvents any               confrontation by smiling and twisting away his wrists. She               throws Bobby the 'Don't worry, I got it' look. He sits.               Horrace pokes his nugget encrusted fingers into his sock,               counting a stack of bills.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                         It's already been a hell of a                         night. Where you been?

BOBBY                         Draw.                                     HORRACE                         What's your record at?                                     BOBBY                         5-5-1.                                     HORRACE                         Yeah, well you let me know when you                         wanna start makin the real money.                                     BOBBY                         Yeah, sure.                                     HORRACE                         I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and                         driving on weekends got to get to                         you after a while. Might be nice to                         buy your lady something. All it                         takes is one fight.               Wendy is now being dry humped by two guys. Jessica looks               over at her, and is concerned. Lines of protocol are               definitely being crossed. Jess' horny guy makes a bold move,               jamming his face in her cleavage.  In a split second, Bobby               has crossed the room and has him by a wrist. The guy is               surprised by Bobby's presence and grotesque appearance.                                     HORNY GUY                         Whu-                                     BOBBY                         There's no touching.                                     HORNY GUY                         But what about them?                                     BOBBY                         I don't give a shit. I work for                         her. No touching.               She hands Bobby a stack of sweaty bills. He walks away,               zipping the roll into his pocket. When he arrives at the               bar, a drunk EXECUTIVE is having a quiet conversation with               Horrace. Horrace looks around, answers, and the executive               picks quite a few hundreds out of his wallet. Horrace walks               him back to Wendy. Bobby grinds his teeth and points to his               empty glass. The bartender pours and watches the interaction               as Wendy walks off with the executive. The party howls as               they leave the room for some privacy.                                     BARTENDER                              (sarcastic)                         That's not allowed.               Bobby downs another drink. Things are now heating up for               Jess as mob mentality takes hold. She squirms. We TRACK BACK               with Bobby's face as he bee lines for the feisty horny guy,               who holds Jess' hips as he grinds her.                                     BOBBY                         I said no touching.                                     HORNY GUY                         Look, man, I'm the bachelor,                         alright? I gave her a hundred bucks                         in tips alone-                                     BOBBY                         Get your hands off of her.                                     HORNY GUY                         Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How                         much for the treatment?                                     BOBBY                         Your dance is over.                                     HORNY GUY                         Come on, dude. The other chick's                         giving my best man a blow job in the                         toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear                         a rubber-               Bobby cracks his face apart with an uppercut. Another guy               rises in protest and is on his ass with a broken nose before               he can speak.                                     JESS                         God damn it...               Bobby drags his girl by the arm to the men's room. He kicks               open the door and grabs Wendy, who is doing coke off a               mirror with her john. He drags the women out. Horrace               disappears. A PARTIER calls to the bartender.                                     PARTIER                         Call the police.               She picks up the phone, but doesn't dial. She hides a               smile. Bobby drags the women down the staircase.               INT. BOBBY'S CAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               Bobby drives, eyes locked on the road. Jess is beside him,               Wendy's in the back.                                     WENDY                         What the fuck was that about?                                     BOBBY                         You wanna get us busted? If Max                         found out you were turning tricks-                                     WENDY                         I got news for you, Bobby, he don't                         give a shit.

I give him                         his cut of seventeen hundred, I                         think he knows I can't make that lap                         dancing.

No more for you. You                         won't be Jess' driver for shit when                         Maxie hears this shit happened again.                                     BOBBY                         Nobody's fuckin talking to you.                                     WENDY                         And how could you fucking leave                         Horrace hanging?

You don't think Horrace would                         leave your white ass in there to                         hang?                                     JESS                         Alright. Enough already. Let's get                         some food. I better call Maxie and                         tell him what happened before he                         hears it on his own.               EXT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               ESTABLISHING SHOT of the upscale renovation.               INT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               Bobby is part of a large CREW OF PLASTERERS midway through               an Amalfi Drive renovation. He trowels a thin coat of               plaster on a kitchen wall. Ricky drags his ass as he sweeps               up dust and diamond wire scraps. The two of them are swollen               to hell as they work side by side in the upscale remodel.                                     RICKY                         So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the                         list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'                                     BOBBY                         I thought you hate that club.                                     RICKY                         I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.                                     BOBBY                         Then why do you try to get in?                                     RICKY                         Fuck them.                                     BOBBY                              (hears something)                         Shhh...               The DECORATOR walks in with a YOUNG COUPLE and their six               year old KID. The decorator is irritating. The husband is a               shlubby Jew. His wife is a hot shiksa.               The kid looks like he might already be gay. The guys work               diligently and quietly.                                     DECORATOR                         And as you can see, we're a little                         behind in here. We always knew the                         kitchen would be the trouble spot.                                     HUSBAND                         When will it be ready? Are we still                         shooting for Christmas? I really                         want Christmas in the new house.                                     DECORATOR                         We're trying. Unfortunately the                         trades are stacking a bit. But look                         at this Italian plaster job. The                         color skim-coat will go on next.                                     WIFE                         It looks great.               Ricky sneaks some eye contact to the wife. She almost               smiles as he peers at her with his battle scarred face. The               little boy pokes his finger into the wet plaster. Bobby               throws him a look. The kid just stares back like he owns him.                                     DECORATOR                         Did you see the stove yet?                                     HUSBAND                         The Viking was delivered?                                     DECORATOR                         Yes, of course. It's in the garage.               They leave. Bobby repairs the plaster damage.                                     RICKY                         You see that, bro? She wants to                         fuck me.               Ricky's pager goes off.                                     RICKY (continues) (CONT'D)                         You see that? My shit's blowing up.               He looks around and grabs the wall phone and dials.                                     BOBBY                         Come on, man. Not with the owners                         here.                                     RICKY                              (phone)                         Hey, baby... Nothing.  What are you                         doing..? Yeah, I'll probably cut out                         early...

(seeing Ricky)                         Get off the fucking phone. Then he                         wants to know why he's still                         sweeping floors. Bobby, you got a                         minute?               Bobby looks concerned. Something's wrong.               EXT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               Bobby and Arthur stand by a gravel pile outside the huge               remodel.

ARTHUR                         Look, Bobby, I don't know what                         happened, and I don't want to know                         what happened, but something's up.

Far as I'm concerned, you're a                         good kid. I got news, though,                         without you here I can't keep on                         your friend.

BOBBY                         Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on                         til I see what's happening.

Bobby walks past the many businesses               that share the structure in tandem.               MEN working in an auto BODY SHOP go about their business,               but discreetly watch as the unfamiliar man passes. Bobby               carries himself with the proper amount of ambivalence. He               then passes a loading dock, which also has a secretive               stench.               Finally, he arrives at a STEEL DOOR, above which is mounted               a video camera, several generations past its prime.               A steel sign reads simply: 'M and M Contracting'.               Bobby rings the bell and looks up to the surveillance               camera. He is buzzed in.               INT. M AND M CONSTRUCTION OFFICES - VAN NUYS - CONTINUOUS               Bobby walks into an anticlimactically mundane office. The               decor is sixties industrial gray. There is a waiting area               next to a flimsy lucite partition/reception window, behind               which is a desk. Behind the desk is AUDREY, the sixty-plus               receptionist whose hair was recently 'set' and colored by               her beautician. Security seems quite lax.                                     BOBBY                         Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see                         Mr. Reuben.                                     AUDREY                         You're Bobby, right?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah.                                     AUDREY                         Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max                         know you're here.               She fiddles with her phone. Bobby sits at the kidney shaped               coffee table. He thumbs through a copy of Redbook.                                     AUDREY (continues) (CONT'D)                         He'll be a minute, hon. You want                         some coffee?                                     BOBBY                         No thank you.                                     AUDREY                         You sure? I just made it.                                     BOBBY                         No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.               He calms his nerves by staring at a recipe for Strawberries               Devonshire.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby walks in. He doesn't seem like he's been there               before. The first thing that hits you is all the               thoroughbred racing shit all over the place.  Brass table               top statues, pictures of jockeys with wreaths,               hand-painted(!) portraits of horses faces. The second thing               you notice is MAX REUBEN. He's an off-the-rack East Coast               Jew.               He's got deep-set eyes and Abe Vigoda brows. He wears a               golf shirt with a little penguin on it, and oversized               reading glasses are perched on his balding head. His nose               was broken in '63. He smiles broadly as Bobby enters. Bobby               forces a relaxed smile.                                     MAX                              (on phone)                         Will ya calm down. Just calm down                         for a minute, Nadeleh. The money                         will be there. How do I know? I just                         know... Yes. Yes, that's exactly                         what I'm saying... You got my word.               He hangs up his rotary phone and looks up to Bobby, who               stands looking at the painting with his ears closed.                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         You like the ponies?                                     BOBBY                         Sure. Yeah.                                     MAX                         You bet the ponies?                                     BOBBY                         Me? No. Not really.                                     MAX                         Smart. Hard as hell to handicap.                         You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast                         game. You know why I like it?                                     BOBBY                         Why?                                     MAX                         It's fixed. That's the only way to                         win. A sure thing. See that horse.                         The blaze.                                     BOBBY                         This one?                                     MAX                         Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in                         '66. Hired a trainer, stall,                         whatever it was. That horse made me                         over a hundred grand. In 'sixties'                         dollars. You know what that is today?                                     BOBBY                         Pshhh...                                     MAX                         A million. Easy.                                     BOBBY                         She was fast, huh?                                     MAX                         Never won a race. But it got me in                         with the trainer. We'd have a thing,                         I don't remember, some fucking                         thing. The jockey would raise his                         whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd                         all go running. People get greedy.                         First they bet small, they keep                         their mouth shut. Within a month's                         time, everyone and their brother was                         in on it. The odds would drop, I                         mean you could watch the goddamn                         board. It looked like a fuckin                         stopwatch, the odds would drop so                         fast.                                     BOBBY                         That's why they call it the smart                         money.               Maxie laughs a genuine laugh.                                     MAX                         I like you, kid. Why do you gotta                         make it so hard for me to take care                         of you?                                     BOBBY                         Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they                         were out of line.                                     MAX                         Last time, maybe, with the Puerto                         Ricans, but these were nice Jewish                         boys.                                     BOBBY                         They were out of line-                                     MAX                         They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You                         didn't have to tear up the goddamn                         place. You knocked out a guys teeth.                                     BOBBY                         That prick tried to get Jessica to                         blow him in the bathroom-                                     MAX                         Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my                         own daughter.  I would kill anyone                         so much as lays a finger on her or                         her beautiful daughter, but that                         fucking pisher you socked in the                         mouth has the most expensive dentist                         in Beverly Hills and wants I should                         buy him an implant. Your silverback                         horseshit's gonna cost me eight                         grand.                                     BOBBY                         I'll work it off.                                     MAX                         Not driving Jess, you won't.

Two strikes, Bobby, and this last                         one was big. The bachelor's father                         goes to my schul.                                     BOBBY                         So, that's it. I'm out?                                     MAX                         I didn't say that.                                     BOBBY                         Then what are you saying?                                     MAX                         Bobby.

It's up to me, and I                         like a sure thing. Just go and we're                         square on the tooth.

BOBBY                         Go finish getting ready. I'll take                         care of dinner.                                     JESS                         Yeah?

Because that's                         how you learn to cook. I watched my                         grandma cook every night. That's how                         I learned. If you can't cook, then                         you gotta go out to eat every night,                         then you spend all your money on                         food. And when you eat in                         restaurants, the cooks scratch their                         ass and touch the food.               There's a knock on the door.                                     JESS (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Could you get that, baby?               He does. It's Horrace.

HORRACE                         Some shit smells good in this                         motherfucker.                                     JESS                         Bobby's cooking.

I'm                         hungry as a motherfucker.               Jess hurries out, brushing her hair.                                     BOBBY                         Watch your mouth in front of the                         baby.               Bobby joins Jess in the back.               INT.

She crosses to the door, abruptly ending the discussion.               Bobby grabs her.                                     BOBBY                         She needs a family. A dad.

I can't go through this                         again.               She leaves the bedroom.               INT.

Max speaks with a               directness suggesting gravity. He lays down two MANILA               ENVELOPES. The two guys pick them up.

Ricky sheepishly draws a length of scotch tape from Max's               desk set dispenser.               Mid-pull, he becomes self-conscious and asks for permission.

You each                         have been given an extra battery, so                         there is absolutely no excuse as to                         why a page would not be immediately                         returned. Am I making myself                         abundantly clear?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah.

RICKY                         What about my keys?                                     MAX                         You can carry your keys. You will                         not mention my name or imply that                         you are in my employ. You will not                         speak to anyone while you are                         working. When you are not working,                         you are considered to be 'on call'                         and available twenty-four hours a                         day. This means you will not get                         drunk or do anything that will                         prevent you from operating in a                         professional manner. There is                         already a number in your pager's                         memory. It is a car service. When                         they ask you what account, you will                         respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will                         pick you up and take you anywhere                         you need to go. In other words,                         there is no reason why you should                         not reach any destination that you                         will be called upon to reach within                         fifteen minutes.

LAX - DAY               One of those cool over cranked tracking shots of the two               guys walking purposefully that means we're really getting               down to business now. A cool song is playing. Ricky and               Bobby each hold a manila envelope.               INT. SECURITY CHECK - LAX - DAY               Bobby lays his envelope on the x-ray conveyor belt. He               walks through the metal detector. He passes the check.               Ricky does the same. The ALARM goes off. Bobby looks               concerned. Ricky pulls a ring of KEYS and drops it in the               tray with a look to Bobby. Bobby looks relieved. Ricky is               dressed to the nines: Dark blazer over a dark sweater.               Bobby, more casual, wears dark slacks, a dark shirt and a               gold horn around his neck.               INT.

BOBBY                         Nah, don't bother-               Ricky rings the service chime. An attractive young FLIGHT               ATTENDANT arrives. She has a tray of champagne and orange               juice.

She smiles and walks away. He               stops mid-gulp and rings the bell again. She turns with a               smile.

She walks away. He turns off the bell light.               INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NEW YORK - DAY               The PASSENGERS file off the plane and out of the gate.               Bobby walks out purposefully. Ricky staggers slightly. He               got his money's worth. Bobby checks his pager and Ricky               scans the crowd through his buzz.                                     BOBBY                         Shit. No new pages.

The pack screams up to the duo.               There are a dozen black men, on Ninjas, and they all wear               black Nazi-style helmets.               The two men freeze, and the bikes settle in around them.               One BIKER pulls up to Bobby.                                     BIKER                         They flew you all the way out here                         to cook me up some fuckin puttanesca?               Bobby recognizes the biker is Horrace, from LA. He is               relieved, but not pleased.                                     RICKY                         You know this guy?                                     BOBBY                         His names Horrace. Horrace, this is                         Ricky Slade.                                     HORRACE                         What's up. You all ready to meet                         Ruiz?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah. Where is he?               Horrace throws him a helmet.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. HARLEM STREETS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT               Bobby now rides bitch behind Ho, and Ricky clutches the               back of a buff shirtless BROTHER. The bikes rip down the               uptown streets with a ferocity that scares pedestrians. An               urban drum track rattles the SOUNDTRACK.               EXT. LITTLE ITALY - MANHATTAN - NIGHT               The horde of bikers rumble under a red, white, and green               banner strung from street lamps marking the start of Italian               turf. The businesses are all closed or closing.               Looks are drawn from locals as the outsiders chug by at a               respectful trawl.               EXT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT               The pack pulls away leaving only Bobby, Ricky, and Horrace.               Ho leans his Ninja to rest next to a custom Buell               Harley-Davidson cafe racer.               Bobby can't help but stare at the rare piece of machinery.               They enter.               INT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - CONTINUOUS               The restaurant is now closed, but RUIZ sits in a rear booth               on a Nokia. He is a slim, young black man with a tight round               fro. He wears a rolex, but, other than that, nothing flashy.               He's wearing dark Gucci slacks, a black pullover crew-neck               shirt, and a black, red and orange racing leather jacket. He               must have pull here, because 'Between the Sheets' is playing               over the stereo of this bare-bones, Italian eatery.                                     RUIZ                              (on cell)                         Nah, man. Nah. Too risky. I don't                         like it... I want out... It's too                         risky... Listen, man, we made a lot                         of money together on this one, but                         it's over. Shit's gonna come down...                         Well, then, you got my blessing. I'm                         selling my end. This internet shit's                         too volatile. I'll keep my block of                         Microsoft, but I'm taking profits on                         Yahoo and all the portal stocks. The                         bubble's gonna pop, man... Alright,                         peace.               The three men approach Ruiz's table.                                     RUIZ (continues) (CONT'D)                         That's it?

Is                         Ruiz on the list?                                     DOORMAN                         Ruiz is always on the list. He just                         ain't here, though.                                     BOBBY                         Can you check?                                     DOORMAN                         He's not here.               While they're waiting, the actor who played SCREECH on               'Saved By the Bell', now in his twenties, walks by and is               let through the rope with a handshake.                                     DOORMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         What's up, man.                                     SCREECH                         S'up.

Ricky can't believe his eyes.                                     RICKY                         Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.

Show me where it says                         Screech on the fucking list.               This altercation is cut short by the arrival of Ruiz and               Horrace. The Red Sea parts as they approach the door.                                     DOORMAN                         What's up, bro? You look big, man,                         you been lifting?                                     RUIZ                         A little. How's it going tonight?                                     DOORMAN                         Shit's off the chain. These two say                         they're with you.                                     RUIZ                         Yeah.                                     DOORMAN                         Alright. These two are good.               He opens the rope. Bobby shakes his hand.                                     DOORMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Sorry, man, but...                                     BOBBY                         Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.                                     DOORMAN                         Any time, bro.                                     BOBBY                         Thanks.               Ricky walks by and throws him a look like he just stuck it               in.               INT. SPA - 13TH STREET - CONTINUOUS               Bobby and Ricky are lead into the club and past a window               and another set of ropes.               Their hands are stamped several times representing the               highest level of security clearance. They file down a               staircase and into one common area where hip-hop plays and               people dance. Ruiz and Horrace touch hands with an endless               stream of ACQUAINTANCES. They pass a myriad of rooms and               seating areas, then down a narrow corridor where they               encounter yet another DOORMAN who waves them past a CLUMP of               VIP hopefuls. They trot down a short bank of stairs and               into...               INT. VIP AREA - SPA - CONTINUOUS               ... a series of passageways furnished like a French parlor.               Lithe MODELS sit amongst Dreadlocked white boys. After yet               another bar, the crowd vomits into a cavernous bomb shelter.               A pulsing dance floor is surrounded by a series of couches               and coffee tables, representing the private seating areas.               At the far end of the room is an elevated stage with a DJ               and a banner reading 'GRANDMASTER FLASH'. The party is               greeted by a male club PROMOTER. He hugs Ruiz. With the               slightest of nods, the party is lead to the prime table with               a table tent marked 'RESERVED.' They sit down as a beautiful               MODEL/WAITRESS brings two buckets of champagne and fluted               glasses. Bobby and Ricky try to hide how impressed they are               as they look at each other. GIRLS on the dance floor throw               priceless looks toward their table. Ricky raises a glass to               one. Ruiz finally looks at them and leans in. He's spotted               someone.                                     RUIZ                         That's him. Now you all know the                         drill, right?                                     BOBBY                         What drill?                                     RICKY                         We don't know any drill. Nobody                         told us anything.                                     RUIZ                         Maxie told you to keep your mouth                         shut while you're working, right?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah.                                     RICKY                         So we're working?                                     RUIZ                         What the fuck you think, I wanna                         'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah                         you're working. And put down the                         champagne.                                     RICKY                         She poured it for-                                     RUIZ                         Far as she knows you're John Gotti.                         Now put the shit down and act like                         you got some ass.               Ruiz gets up and crosses to a BRITISH looking GUY across               the room. They watch.                                     BOBBY                         He making the drop?                                     HORRACE                         Nah, man. He's just making contact.                         That's our man. The Welsh guy.                                     BOBBY                         What's his name?                                     HORRACE                         Ruiz don't like using names on cell                         phones. He refers to him as the Red                         Dragon.                                     BOBBY                         So, when's the drop.                                     HORRACE                         To be honest, man, I don't know                         shit either. All I know is it ain't                         drugs and it ain't now.                                     RICKY                         How do you know it's not drugs?                                     HORRACE                         Maxie knows I don't go near drugs.

RICKY                         You strapped?                                     HORRACE                              (confused)                         'Strapped?'                                     RICKY                         It means you got a gun?                                     HORRACE                         I know what 'strapped' means,                         motherfucker. What the fuck you                         think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'                              (notices)                         Cool out, they're coming back. Just                         throw up your screw face and don't                         speak unless spoken to.               They settle in and Ruiz comes back with the WELSHMAN.               They're both laughing.                                     RUIZ                         Here, man, sit down.                                     WELSHMAN                              (breaking the                              tension)                         I see you brought along the rogues                         gallery.                                     RUIZ                         Not really. Just some friends from                         out West. This is Ho, Bobby, and                         Rick.               He shakes their hands, keeping it light.                                     WELSHMAN                         And here I thought you flew in some                         out of town muscle. How's it going,                         men?                                     RICKY                         So, you must be the Red Dragon.               This draws GLARES from Ruiz, Ho, and especially Bobby.               After an uncomfortable pause, the Welshman breaks the               tension with laughter.                                     WELSHMAN                         Well, that's news to me. The name's                         Tom.                                     RICKY                         Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh,                         'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?                                     WELSHMAN                         Edinburgh.                                     RICKY                         And where might that be?                                     WELSHMAN                         Scotland.

RICKY                         A rose by any other name would--                                     RUIZ                              (changing the                              subject)                         Come here, there's someone I want                         you to meet.

Ruiz sneaks a glare.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF SPA - 13TH STREET - NIGHT               Ricky and Bobby are being lectured by Ruiz, who sits across               from them next to Horrace.                                     RUIZ                         What the fuck was you told? Don't                         talk, right?                                     RICKY                         Unless spoken to, ain't that right,                         Horrace. Didn't you say that?                                     HORRACE                         Don't drag my ass into this-                                     RICKY                         He spoke to me. You want me to dis                         him?                                     RUIZ                         'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a                         position to 'dis', or 'give props',                         or whatever your Real World sense of                         fucking decorum tells you to do.                         You're nothing. You're wallpaper.                         You're not here to make fucking                         friends. Asking a motherfucker where                         he lives. And who the fuck told you                         'Red Dragon'?.                                     BOBBY                         We get it. We're sorry.                                     RUIZ                         Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy                         and wants to change shit around on                         me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when                         he hears about... Aw, shit, I better                         call him before he hears.               Ruiz pulls out his cell phone and steps out, slamming the               door.                                     HORRACE                         I'm not saying shit to neither of                         you.                                     RICKY                         Why? What I say bad?                                     HORRACE                         What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'                                     RICKY                         What? Why am I bad?                                     BOBBY                         How bad is it?                                     HORRACE                         It's bad. Before you even showed                         up, he said you were Maxie's 'token                         goons', and not to be trusted. He                         wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna                         ride shotgun to keep the English                         dude above board. Now he's spooked.                         This shit's snowballing.                                     BOBBY                         When's it going down?

Outside, Ruiz starts his bike. Horrace slides out.                                     HORRACE                         See you later.

Horrace closes the door and starts his bike. They ride off.                                     BOBBY                         You happy?

He opens the door.                                     BOBBY                         Where do you think you're going?

Ricky walks past the line with a handshake. Bobby sits,               staring forward.                                     JIMMY                         Where to?                                                                    CUT TO:               INT.

Cynthia whispers too loud and drunk.                                     CYNTHIA                         Is he cute?

BIANCA                         I don't know. Do whatever you want.                                     CYNTHIA                         He's great, right. Is he great?                                     BIANCA                         He's alright.                                     CYNTHIA                              (disappointed)                         I know.                                     BIANCA                              (cheerleader)                         But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's                         just what you need.                                     BOBBY                         Can you excuse me for a minute?               Bobby leaves the room. He finds Ricky in a hotel robe               filling the BATHTUB.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         What the fuck's going on?                                     RICKY                         Dude, get back out there. You gotta                         help me get them in the hot tub.                              (shouts)                         Hang on girls! Just get out there.                         I'll be right out. You know how I do.                                     BOBBY                         Yeah, I know how you do. I know how                         you do. I've heard your kibbles and                         bits all fucking night. You've been                         shaking your ass like an unemployed                         clown. How the room's a boiling pot                         of sugar water. How you're gonna dip                         a string into it and make rockcandy.                         Who wants to play 'Just the tip?'                         Dancing around like a smacked ass.                         Oh, and that coat check girl you've                         been dragging around as 'insurance'                         doesn't even speak English.                              (leaves)               Ricky checks the water and comes out talking.                                     RICKY                         Okay. We got a lot happening here.                         Here comes the good part... Okay...                                     BIANCA                              (re: robe)                         Somebody's getting comfortable.                                     CYNTHIA                         Where's the surprise?                                     RICKY                         You want your surprise?                                     CYNTHIA                         Yeah. I want it.                                     RICKY                         Well, come on then. It's back here.               Cynthia leaves with Ricky. Bobby is left with Bianca and               the Asian coat check girl. Bianca and he are uncomfortable.               After a long pause...                                     BIANCA                         You mind if I roll a joint?               Ricky sits in the BATHTUB with a glass of champagne.                                     RICKY                         You want to come splash around.                                     CYNTHIA                         I'm just warning you, I can't swim.               Then... Bianca sparks up. She offers to Bobby, who refuses.                                     BIANCA                         I'm not like her, you know. I mean,                         I'm not judging, but I'm more about                         my dogs. Do you have dogs? Are you a                         dog guy?                                                                    CUT TO:               Cynthia lets her towel drop. She dips her toe into the               water. Out of nowhere she begins to wail. Back in the main               room Bobby, Bianca, and the Asian girl react to the               off-screen crying. Cynthia comes rushing out in a bathrobe,               bursting with tears. Ricky follows in a towel.                                     CYNTHIA                         I want to leave right now.                                     RICKY                         I didn't do anything--                                     BOBBY                         What the hell did you do?                                     RICKY                         I swear to God, I didn't do                         anything.                                     BIANCA                         Oh no. What is it this time.                                     CYNTHIA                         We used to take baths together.                                     BIANCA                         Come on. Let's go.               Cynthia calls her boyfriend on the cell phone.                                     CYNTHIA                         Sean? I want you to pick me up... I                         know. I'm sorry too.               They leave.                                     BOBBY                         What the fuck was that about?                                     RICKY                         She was jonesing for me.               They notice the Asian girl still sitting there in the room.               Bobby hands her cab fare and escorts her out.                                     BOBBY                         Here you go, darling. Get home safe.               BEEBEEP... BEEBEEP...Both their pagers go off.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Fuck.               He reaches for the phone. Dials.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Hi.                              (mouthes to Ricky)                         It's Ruiz.                              (phone)                         Yeah. So the driver knows where to                         go? When? We'll be down in five. No,                         I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.                                     RICKY                         What's up?                                     BOBBY                         He wants to see us now.                                     RICKY                         Where?                                     BOBBY                         He said it's being arranged. He                         said Jimmy will know.                                     RICKY                         We're getting whacked.                                     BOBBY                         We're not getting whacked.                                     RICKY                         Why else you think he won't tell us                         where the sit down is?                                     BOBBY                         It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's                         telling us the plan.               Ricky is waving around a STEAK KNIFE from a room service               tray, testing the weight and balance.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         What are you doing.                                     RICKY                         I got a bad feeling, man. I don't                         want to go in naked.                                     BOBBY                         You gonna shank him in the shower?                                     RICKY                         Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz,                         who doesn't even want us here, is                         throwing us to the wolves? As an                         apology? And I don't even know what                         we're dropping off or picking up -                                     BOBBY                         We're getting ahead of ourselves.                         We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's                         just keep our mouthes shut and not                         make any mistakes. Now hurry up and                         get your shit on so we're not late                         and make things worse.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - MORNING               Ricky and Bobby look awful. They have bags under their               swollen eyes, gorged stomachs, bruised faces, tattered               clothes, and yolk on their chin. Ricky lights a smoke.                                     BOBBY                         Put that shit out...                                     RICKY                         C'mon, man...                                     BOBBY                         I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.                                     RICKY                              (obliging)                         Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?               Ricky looks at him without an ounce of humor. Jimmy laughs.                                     JIMMY                         If they're whacking you, they're                         doing it in style.               The limo pulls up to...               EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - CENTRAL PARK - MORNING -               CONTINUOUS               Jimmy lets them out.               INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER               The MAITRE D' leads them past an orgy of a BUFFET.               Everything looks sickening to our bloated drunks. The head               of a whitefish in particular makes an impression on the               boys.               They are lead to a table joining Ruiz and Horrace, who are               both dressed appropriately for a society brunch.                                     RUIZ                         Jesus Christ, where the fuck you                         been all night? You look like you                         got shit out in the gorilla house.                                     BOBBY                         Good morning.                                     HORRACE                              (laughs)                         Good morning.                                     RUIZ                         You think this shit's funny, Ho?                                     HORRACE                         Nah, man...                                     RUIZ                         You think it's funny, motherfucker?                                     BOBBY                         Easy, Ruiz.               A WAITER shows up.                                     RUIZ                         Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned                         a Easter egg hunt into a                         butt-fuck-a-thon.                              (to waiter)                         Bring me four eggs Benedict and a                         mimosa. You all want mimosas?                                     BOBBY                              (ill)                         Nah, man...                                     RICKY                         No...                                     RUIZ                         Four mimosas.                              (to guys)                         You'll love them. So here's the                         plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie,                         cause the man has acute angina, and                         I don't want to get him all worked                         up.

Maxie had me hook up a loan-back                         with him, through an Austrian                         passbook account.

I                         coulda turned it over offshore in a                         week, but Maxie likes to do it all                         his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the                         bag alone. It's only two hundred                         G's. But he sent you all. So I can                         either send you home and tell Maxie,                         or we can flush the toilet one more                         time and hope it all goes down.

Maybe lost                         his whole line of clientele? He                         knows you're fucking up Jess'                         dancing, and I got a feeling he                         knows I stole his carpet cleaning                         van by the way he looks at me. He                         can't kill us in LA cause that leads                         to too many questions. So he flies                         us out here first class for a 'drop'                         that's turned into whatever?

Ricky is preoccupied by a               projected image on the wall.                                     WELSHMAN                         This is the greatest fucking                         country in the world. I love this                         fucking place.

OUTSIDE THE STALL, the attendant watches the feet shuffle               as they curse from within. INSIDE, Tom snorts a pile of               cocaine from Horrace's outstretched hand.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Fuck, that's good shit. So, what's                         say we make a go of this and you                         drop off the cash tomorrow?               Finally.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - LATER - NIGHT               The limo settles to a STOP to drop off Horrace.                                     HORRACE                         Now, here's what worries me. He                         said he wants to meet up at a bar in                         Red Hook. You know where that is?                                     BOBBY                         No.                                     HORRACE                         Brooklyn.

BOBBY                         What do you mean 'troughed?'                                     HORRACE                         Troughed off. Protected. Like, you                         know, like he got a moat around it.                                     BOBBY                         Ruiz tied in out there?                                     HORRACE                         Nah, man. No one is. They got some                         Puerto Ricans and a new crop of                         fuckin Irish immigrants.                                     RICKY                         I'm half Irish.                                     HORRACE                         I don't fuck with those crazy,                         off-the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard                         of the Westies?.                                     BOBBY                         Heard of them.                                     HORRACE                         They ran shit back in the Eighties.                         Used to cut motherfuckers heads off                         and sit them on the bar. That's back                         when the Irish was making a play                         against the Italians. I don't know                         if they still around, but I don't                         fuck with those motherfuckers just                         in case.                                     BOBBY                         It sounds to me like everybody's                         just a little jumpy. And since all                         it is is a drop, the Welshman's got                         nothing at stake. I say we go to his                         'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his                         nerves, we drop the bag, and we all                         get back to our lives.

LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - DAY               They pull up to the Soho Grand. Ricky wakes Bobby, who               begins to doze.                                     RICKY                         Get up brother. We're home. Go up                         and get some sleep.               INT. BOBBY'S SUITE - SOHO GRAND HOTEL - DAY               Bobby drags himself into his suite. He drops his drawers               and lays down. Instead of sleeping, he picks up the phone               and dials.                                     CHLOE (V.O.) (V.O.)                         Hello.

Did Ricky call                         yet..? See you in a minute.               He sits up, hunched over. He motivates reluctantly. He               claws his way into the bathroom and rinses his face in a               meagre attempt to wash away the cobwebs. He looks awful. The               COLORS are beginning to INTENSIFY as sleep deprivation sets               in.               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER               Bobby sits into the car once again. Jimmy pulls away.                                     BOBBY                         Aren't we waiting for Ricky?                                     JIMMY                         Ricky's taken care of.

Bobby fights to clear his head and think.               EXT. CITY STREET - MANHATTAN - DAY               The limo pulls up, and Horrace steps in, talking on the               phone. Horrace carries a BRIEFCASE.               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS               The car pulls away. Bobby has the no-sleep-sweats. He looks               awful. No one greets anyone. There is a tension. Horrace is               on the phone.                                     HORRACE                              (phone)                         Yeah... Yeah... Uhu... I can't                         really talk now, but it's all going                         as planned. If things change, I'll                         call.               He hangs up. PAUSE.                                     BOBBY                         Where we going?                                     HORRACE                         Quick drop.

HORRACE                         He was uptown when I paged him. I                         gave him the address. He's meeting                         us there.

EXT. LIMOSINE - BROOKLYN - DAY               The car crosses the Brooklyn Bridge and drives through               Brooklyn.               INT. LIMOSINE - BROOKLYN - SAME               Bobby is watching and thinking as Brooklyn goes by. Horrace               seems distant.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - BROOKLYN - DAY               The limo passes the corner and settles in front of the time               worn Icarus Tavern.               A young IRISH MAN stands out front smoking a fag. The place               is open, but the neon 'OPEN' sign is off.               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF THE ICARUS - CONTINUOUS               They pop the doors.                                     HORRACE                         This is it.                                     BOBBY                         Where's Ricky.                                     HORRACE                         I guess inside. Or he never made                         it. Either way, I don't give a shit.                         Let's get this over with.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               The two guys get out and enter the pub. Horrace carries the               case of cash. The guy at the door watches them enter and               snuffs out his smoke.               INT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               They enter the old world gin mill. It's dark. There's a               long, aged wooden bar and oak booths. The floor boards are               faded and bowed. A middle-aged BARTENDER reads the Post by               the oversized beer taps. He looks up over his reading               glasses without expression. Two young Irish TOUGHS stand up               from a booth and lead the men into the back room. There is a               silent tension. No sign of Ricky.               INT. BACK ROOM - ICARUS TAVERN - CONTINUOUS               Even darker. They slowly walk in, sending cautious looks to               every corner. A simple round table sits in the center of               this sparse dining room. Three ROGUES sit around it, all               facing the door.  Tom, the Welshman, sits with his back to               the door. They all have pints before them. A muted               conversation ends as Tom follows their stares over his               shoulder to see Bobby and Horrace enter. Silence for a BEAT,               then...                                     WELSHMAN                         Here they are, then.                                     HORRACE                              (falsely relaxed)                         How's it going?                                     WELSHMAN                         Brilliantly.

WELSHMAN                         Come, now. You just got here.                                     HORRACE                         That's alright, man. It's a little                         early for me to drink.               This draws an uncomfortably bass chuckle from the seven               dark characters now surrounding them.                                     WELSHMAN                         Nonsense. We'll have three half                         pints of lager.               One Irishman goes to fetch the drinks. Two of the Irishmen               pat them down for guns.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Sorry about that. Where's your mate?                                     HORRACE                         Couldn't make it. Here's the money.               Horrace places the case on the table. Its weight makes a               loud thunk as it hits the hardwood. He pops the catch and               lifts the lid. Wow. That's a lot of money. The toughs lose               their poker faces as their knees weaken from the sight of               it. Even Bobby has to swallow as the Devil blows on his               nape. Tom fingers the stacks.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                              (anxious)                         Give me your marker, and we'll be                         on our way.               Tom begins to write out a receipt.                                     WELSHMAN                         I can't yet vouch for the amount,                         unless you want me to sit here and                         count.                                     HORRACE                         No, man, that's fine. Just put that                         you took delivery.               Then, in what takes only a matter of seconds, Bobby has a               LOCKBLADE to his THROAT and Horrace takes a truncheon to the               gut, flooring him.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                         What the fuck, man? Why? The                         money's in your hand. Why you                         pulling this shit?               Tom is scared shit. He's more surprised than any of them.                                     WELSHMAN                         I... I just hired these guys to                         watch my back...                                     HORRACE                         Motherfucker, we're handing you                         money. What the hell we gonna pull?                                     ROGUE                         Shut your goddamn mouth! As far as                         any of you are concerned, a gang of                         spics took the bag. Understood? Grab                         their wallets. I'll know where to                         find each and every one of you.                                     WELSHMAN                         didn't know, I swear to God, I-               WHACK. He takes one in the gut, violently losing his wind.                                     HORRACE                              (to Bobby)                         If you and your boy set this up,                         you're way out of your league.                                     ROGUE                         Shut up!                                     VOICE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Maybe you're the one who better                         shut up.               They all turn to see RICKY standing tall with a PISTOL to               the head of a tough with two beers. Ricky sips the third               lager.                                     ROGUE                         He's only got six shots, he's bound                         to miss.                                     RICKY                         Or maybe I'm real lucky. I'll tell                         you one thing, I'll waste every                         bullet making sure you're dead if                         you don't take that knife away from                         my friends throat.               The thug removes the blade from Bobby's neck. His eyes               narrow as he looks at the gun. He notices something...                                     THUG                         That's a starter pistol.                                     RICKY                              (covering)                         What?                                     THUG                         His gun's a starter pistol. I can                         see the red plug in the barrel.               The toughs begin to relax and converge...                                     RICKY                              (nervous)                         Are you willing to risk your life                         over-               But the moment proves enough of a distraction for Bobby to               unload a damaging COMBINATION to his captor. He may not have               what it takes to cut it as a professional boxer, but these               untrained goons are way outclassed. He drops one like a lead               weight. It's about to get ugly as weapons are raised.               Then... The melee is cut short by a resounding VOICE calling               from the door.                                     JIMMY                         That's enough.               Jimmy the driver stands in the door aiming a Glock 45 at               the crowd.               They all freeze.                                     JIMMY (continues) (CONT'D)                         You guys, over in the corner. Leave                         the hardware and your wallets on the                         table.                              (to bartender)                         Make out an invoice on damages. You                         got e-mail?                              (nods. Jimmy hands                              him a card.)                         E-mail it to me. A check will                         arrive. Call the number at the                         bottom and tell them the Rook is                         code four. Then destroy the card.                              (to Bobby)                         Nice. I'll let Maxie know you're                         good in the pocket.                              (to Ricky)                         Staduch.                              (to the guys)                         Go. I'll take care of this.               Things are about to get ugly. Bobby grabs the case. They               split.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - MOMENTS LATER               They get in. The limo pulls out.               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF THE ICARUS - CONTINUOUS               Horrace peels out and Bobby, Ricky, Horrace, and the Red               Dragon all sit in silence catching their breath. Bobby holds               the case. Looks are exchanged.                                     RICKY                         Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.                                     BOBBY                              (interrupts)                         Take us right to Kennedy. Now.               Horrace nods.                                                                  FADE OUT.               FADE UP ON:               INT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby and Ricky sit before Max. They look the worst we've               ever seen them. They've obviously not slept or changed yet               and flew right out after the melee.               Maxie looks at the open case of cash.               A long, tense BEAT of unclear reaction. Is Maxie mad or               happy. Finally...                                     MAX                         You did good.               He throws them each a bundle off the top of the pile of               bills. Ten grand stacks?                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         I never intended to test you two to                         that extent, but you both came                         through. I should've been informed                         there was a flag on the play, but                         I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made                         a few calls back East. Those punks                         weren't tied in with anyone. As for                         the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He                         was just plain dumb. As for you,                         Ricky, your draw will go towards a                         new carpet cleaning van.                                     RICKY                         But, Max-                                     MAX                         We're square.                                     RICKY                         Yes, sir.                                     MAX                         And, as for you, Bobby, you just                         moved up a notch. Your days of                         fighting for crumbs is through. Take                         a week off, come back, and we'll                         talk about the next thing.                                     BOBBY                         There won't be a next thing.                                     MAX                         Take a few days-                                     BOBBY                         I don't need a few days. I'm gonna                         settle down with Jess. She's through                         dancing. We're opening a restaurant.                                     MAX                         Hate to ruin your fairy tale, but                         I've been paying Jess' rent for six                         months. She's got to keep dancing-               Bobby throws his stack of cash at Maxie. Ricky grimaces.                                     BOBBY                         She's through too. Thank you for                         the opportunity, Max. We'll see you                         around.               They rise to leave.                                     MAX                              (smiling)                         You got a lot to learn, kid. Say hi                         to Jess for me.               EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS               - NIGHT               The Trans Am pulls up in front of Jess' house. Bobby and               Ricky both pop out. We catch the end of a conversation.                                     RICKY                         Dude, we were practically made...                                     BOBBY                         I'll drop you off in a minute. I                         want to see if the baby's up. You                         wanna come in?                                     RICKY                         No. I'll wait here.                                     BOBBY                         I'll be a minute.               Bobby trots up the stairs. Ricky lights a smoke and watches               him go. We linger on his look.               INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               The door opens. The living room looks like a disaster area.               The sink is full of dishes, stacked high above the counter.               Dirty clothes are strewn all over. Half eaten plates of food               are on the coffee table and bags of carry-out containers and               pizza boxes lie about. In the center of it all, Chloe sits               alone watching a Hollywood Hills brushfire on the news.  She               looks up with the solemnity of one much older.                                     BOBBY                         Where's mommy? Did she leave you                         alone again?               Chloe looks to the back room as she sips from her juice               box. Bobby sees a MIRROR and COKE laid out on the table. He               grits his teeth and goes for the bedroom door.               INT. BEDROOM - JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS               Bobby bursts in to find Jess in bed with the HORNY BACHELOR               whose nose he broke the week before. The guy jumps in fear.               Jess is startled and coked out of her mind.                                     HORNY GUY                         I-I-I...

JESS                         Goodbye, Bobby.                                     BOBBY                         Just so you know, I bought you out                         with Maxie. I suggest you leave                         while you can.                                     JESS                         Don't you get it? I don't want to                         leave. This is who I am.                                     BOBBY                         Tell you the truth, I don't give a                         shit for me. But that little girl is                         so special, and you're gonna fuck                         her up.               He crosses to go, but is interrupted by...                                     JESS                              (quietly)                         Take her.

She squeezes him with all her might.               We see Bobby's relief and happiness over her shoulder.                                                                   FADE TO:               EXT.

The               CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS along the road as the car closes               slowly. We hear Chloe's angelic voice as she sings a melody.               As the car draws closer, we see Bobby, still in the clothes               from the trip, driving. There is luggage packed for a               journey. Bobby looks content. When the car finally settles               into a TWO-SHOT through the windshield, we notice SMOKE               coming from the back seat. A moment later, Ricky sits up               behind them. He is half awake and cranky.                                     RICKY                         Baby, you got the sweetest voice I                         ever heard, but Uncle Ricky's gotta                         sleep. I've been driving all night,                         Princess.               She ignores him.                                     RICKY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Shhh, c'mon, baby. It's quiet time.                         Isn't it quiet time, Bobby? Bobby?                         Tell her it's quiet time Bobby.                         Please tell her it's quiet time...               Bobby smirks and accelerates, passing CAMERA, which PANS to               watch them speed off into the big sky horizon.                                                             FADE TO BLACK."

Studios         I AM LEGEND   FADE IN:  WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT  WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON  ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, ""Everybody's Out Of Town."" Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a sten gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.   REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE  CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE  IN F.G. is Nevilles sten gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME.  CUT TO:   CREDIT MONTAGE  A rapid series of SHOTS as titles begin. Title of film is not shown now but held to the last frame of the film. Titles begin with star names, etc. and are distributed over following scenes except where noted.    ALIEN MISSILE being raised to point toward sky.  FACE OF CHINESE SOLDIER twisted with anger, SCREAMING.  TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS READING NEWS   MATTHIAS ... the Sino-Russian border war continues to escalate, according to...   ANOTHER MISSILE RISING. Under this and subsequent FLASH CUTS there should be the constant CRACKLING SOUND of RADIO transmissions in Russian and Chinese.   MEETING ROOM with a small number of officials angry, frightened. On the wall behind there are crossed red flags, a portrait of Lenin.   ANOTHER MISSILE. We HEAR, overlapping one another, Chinese and Russian VOICES counting down almost together from ten to one like a chorus of doom. Missile is fired SOUND BREAKS OFF.   FLASH CUTS OF SERIES OF ATOMIC BLASTS, one after another, each one a slightly CLOSER SHOT, garbled RADIO TRANSMISSIONS under SHOTS -- including French, Russian, Chinese, British and American accents.   BRITISH  ...totalyes, totalno survivor  (break)The embassyterrible...   AMERICAN Jesus, Jesus Christ...you never (break) ...Vladivastok ... nothing ... nothing...   INT. OMAHA SITUATION ROOM with giant illuminated wall-map of world, various equipment, military personnel sitting at consoles. In F.G. a YOUNG OFFICER is leaning across a desk, speaking to OLDER OFFICER. In his face is real fear.   OFFICER  Theyve ... gone ape, Sir ... gone ape...   As he speaks, WE HEAR the CRACKLING ground-bass of radio TRANSMISSIONS, cut, broken. ""Condition Yellow ... Yellow Alert ... Attention ... Yellow Alert...""   ZOOM SHOT - PAST OFFICERTS FACE TO ILLUMINATED WALL MAP  At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East. Radio transmissions increase in intensity, volume, and in the GARBLED HYSTERIA, which is just below the voices. ""Condition Red ... Red... Red ... Bogies on screen ... origin ... What is origin? What is origin?... Asia ... no, Jesus, from all over. They're both ... we see... both of them are ...   PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES IN SPACE  SOUND is killed for this and similar SHOTS. Alien missiles apparently motionless in space with the earth turning very slowly below.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES being raised, fired.  CLOSE SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIAN  in Omaha Situation Room. He is monitoring anti-missiles as they head for incoming missiles. Radio transmissions again: ""...two minutes thirty to initial intercept. Tracking is...ninety seconds to initial...   PROCESS SHOT - ANTI-MISSILES IN SPACE  showing anti-missiles zeroing in on the much larger alien missiles. SOUND OFF. WE SEE some of the small missiles about to hit the larger ones.   MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  at consoles. CAMERA PANS TO WALL MAP showing small blips conjoining with the large ones6 SOUND SUDDENLY. ""Abort antis ... repeat abort.... configuration...""    MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  They frown at one another, one shrugs. SOUND: another VOICE, ""Impact... Impact... score mounting. Impact on thirty percent of incoming ... now fifty-one point six. Impact..""   PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES COLLIDING   MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  as they hear the transmissions, their expression of nonunderstanding turns to one of panic. SOUND: Initial VOICE, ""Abort firings. Missiles do not conform to nuclear-configurations. Repeat, abort firings. Do not intercept. Non-nuclear attack underway ... Repeat, non-nuclear attack underway.  PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING  Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion.  CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed.   VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER  CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear.   VERY CLOSE SHOT - CAR STRIKING POLE  The driver is dead or dying. His car veers crazily into another car, ends up striking pole.  TV ANNOUNCER - IN THE CLEAR MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS ... the entire Los Angeles area. Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain and Civil Defense authorities state that the situation is much the same...   MED. SHOT - TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS  from between heads of two people watching TV. We watch the screen and then, as fragment of news reporter's story is cut off, CAMERA REVERSES showing people watching are dead, eyes, mouths open.     MATTHIAS ... across the entire country. Martial law is now nation-wide. Whether a state of war between China and Russia -still exists is not important any longer. Our fellow countrymen are dying. The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble...   CLOSE SHOT - RADIO  It is a small transistor on a counter in a filling station. As CAMERA PULLS OUT showing station deserted, cars stopped here and there, a man and woman dead in a convertible at the gas pumps.    ANNOUNCER ... CONELRAD channel. This is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways. Stay in your homes...   CLOSE SHOT - RADIO IN POLICE CAR  We SEE the receiver, HEAR the emergency message as CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing a policeman lying, eyes open, across the steering wheel of the car.   ANNOUNCER Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution ... Repeat This is a...    LONG SHOT - DOWN A H0SPITAL CORRIDOR  As the CAMERA PANS HALLS, WARDS, ETC., there are, here and there, a few bodies in the hallways, the beds are full.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN THE CLEAR - NEVILLE IN LABORATORY  Neville sits at his desk in white lab coat, sign on desk says COLONEL ROBERT NEVILLE. He is watching a small TV on his desk.   MATTHIAS so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel?  Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS.    MATTHIAS We were warned of judgment. Well, It's come now. This is the Judgement, the weeping and  gnashing of teeth... Oh, God, where will it end...?   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE ON PHONE  nodding, face set.   NEVILLE Yes. Soits airborne bacteria. Let's try-vaccine 93-b-71. How the hell do I know? I don't... It might. Ill be there in an hour.  NEVILLE RUNNING DOWN CORRIDORS  with small satchel.  NEVILLE ON AIRSTRIP running toward waiting helicopter. He wears fatigue coveralls.  NEVILLE IN AIRBORNE HELICOPTER with satchel of vaccine in lap. PILOT next to-him.  ZOOM SHOT - TO PILOT  grabbing eyes, falling forward onto controls.   HELICOPTER GOING DOWN  Neville showing signs of illness too.   HELICOPTER CRASHED  Neville drags himself from wreck. Only one bottle of vaccine is unbroken. He injects himself, passes out.  LAST TITLE  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  MED. LONG SHOT - INT. DARK TRAVEL AGENCY  from rear of office. There are posters on the walls: ""See Mexico."" ""Visit London,"" ""TWA to Hong Kong,"" etc. Dust is over everything, the floors are filthy and-, littered with paper. CAMERA points out OPEN DOOR to street. Suddenly we SEE Neville FLASH by in his car.  CUT TO:  LONG BOOM SHOT - DOWN ANGLE ON EMPTY STREET  from roof of building. In left F.G. WE SEE clothesline. Clothes hanging on it are bleached. have begun to fall apart. We HEAR in DISTANCE ' high-pitched ROAR of Neville's ENGINE. Then he races by in street below.  CUT TO:  MED. SHOT - DESERTED SCHOOL ROOM  CAMERA points out OPEN WINDOWI- with a broken blind hanging alongside. In left frame, next window has Easter bunnies, eggs, etc. made by children. In right side of frame, teacher's desk with small flag, rotten apple. Again, SOUND of CAR, Neville passes outside.  CUT TO:   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  As he rounds corner, he sees things lying scattered in the street ahead. He tries to stop, but runs over them.   CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR  He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded.    MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically.   NEVILLE  Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses.    NEVILLE  There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire?   MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING  Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. A 230SL convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car.   NEVILLE The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...?  He walks to another car.   NEVILLE  How about this one? One careful Pasadena driver in tennis shoes?  What's her phone number?   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE SERVICING CAR  He has put in battery, gas, etc. He closes hood, gets in. Glances at watch.   NEVILLE  My God, is it that late?  He guns the motor and drives out through the broken window.  CUT TO: .  WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on.  CUT TO:   WIDE ANGLE SHOT - A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour.  CUT TO:   VERY CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  This is HEAD ON. Nevilles concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night.  CUT TO:  WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  CAMERA RUSHES IN as SHOT OPENS, to MED. SHOT of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb.   VERY CLOSE SHOT - TIRES AND LOWER SECTION OF CAR  Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed.  MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR  As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage.   MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE  from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his sten gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror.   REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA  Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  CAMERA JERKS as Neville fires his sten gun directly into LENS. Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing.   MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA  The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished.  Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head.   NEVILLE  That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR  Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor.   NEVILLE  Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game.  He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter.   NEVILLE  Some game...  CUT TO:   LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE  The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops sten gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure.   NEVILLE  Okay, Okay, Im ready.  CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.   NEVILLE  Go ahead ... move.  Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder.    NEVILLE  Why dont you have a belt? It might improve your game.  He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on.   NEVILLE  But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill...  CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Nevilles loneliness and isolation tell on him.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch.   NEVILLE  You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out.  So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky...  Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment)   NEVILLE  From time to time he gets nervous.  He smells the end game coming...  Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G.  Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set.   NEVILLE But end games are fall of surprises, arent they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check!  He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down.   MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW  We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing ""We'll Be Together Again.""    RECORD No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again...  Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. ""Harlem Nocturne,"" Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo.   MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD  Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS.    ZACHARY (O.S.)  Come out, Neville  Neville sighs, smiles at bust.   NEVILLE  Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment.  He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher.  REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW    NEVILLE They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards...   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW  He raises the rifle.  LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT  PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute.   NEVILLE Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that?  CUT TO:  MED. LONG BOOM SHOT - NEVILLE AT TABLE  SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte)  DISSOLVE TO:  CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG.  Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment.   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  Three? You're sure? Not three.   ZACHARY (O.S.) Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua...  CAMERA TURNS RIGHT, bringing Matthias INTO FRAME, CLOSE SHOT, head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses.    MATTHIAS  The light, you have to stay clear of the light...  CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively.   ZACHARY  Brother, there wasn't no light...  That cat hit Joshua in pitch black...   MATTHIAS  He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light.  Zachary shrugs.   ZACHARY  Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light.   Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first.   MATTHIAS one creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man...   ZACHARY  He aint a man, Brother.   MATTHIAS No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that...   ZACHARY  Pig-paradise, Brother?   MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND ZACHARY  Matthias smiles sadly.   MATTHIAS Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one...  Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin.   ZACHARY  Hog heaven, then...  But Matthias is getting worked up.   MATTHIAS Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things!   CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY  He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again.   ZACHARY  Well, let me put the power on him. Look...  CAMERA FOLLOWS his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. CAMERA SNAPS BACK to ZACHARY.   ZACHARY ...or there's cannons. I can go to the old Guard armory. I could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose...  MED. SHOT - GROUP - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY  We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads.  Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child.  MATTHIAS  Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that.  Any one of us could. But if we did,  The curse would begin once more,  don't you see that?  CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY  Zachary is sullen.    ZACHARY  I see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down  here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while  We sleep?   MED. GROUP SHOT MATTHIAS, ZACHARY, OTHERS      MATTHIAS  Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed.  But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden.  They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed  the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away...  As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down.   MATTHIAS And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder...  As he speaks SLOW DISSOLVE from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.'  VERY LONG SHOT TOP STORY OF NEVILLE'S APARTMENT  FADE OUT       FADE IN:  MED. LONG SHOT - EMPTY STREET, EARLY MORNING  The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING  He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his sten gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.   NEVILLE ...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville.  He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. CAMERA MOVES OUT FOR MED. LONG SHOT OF NEVILLE, down ANGLE from building POINT OF VIEW.     NEVILLE This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery. (sardonically)  You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He unlimbers sten gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.   NEVILLE You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now.  Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts   NEVILLE If I could find the nest, find where he stays thered be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough...  He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment.   NEVILLE But what would I do then...?  CUT TO:   SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE SEARCHING  He moves through dark corridors, into rooms. He is very efficient in his checking, spending only a few moments in each place.   MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM  Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, sten gun ready.   CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED  The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION  He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN BASEMENT  He probes in comers, closets. Obviously is well practiced at this ""search and destroy"" technique.  . MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN OFFICE BUILDING  He is moving. rapidly through offices, dust everywhere, files, etc. scattered. He always checks closets, etc.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING DOWN  His eyes narrow, he leans over and reaches down into wastebasket.   REVERSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - NEVILLE ABOVE   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He lifts up a sardine can, oil drips from it. Neville smiles viciously.  CLOSE SHOT - WASTE BASKET  In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE  Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.  LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER  It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.   NEVILLE (O.S.)  All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company.   Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of sten gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME. We cannot see eyes of figure.   NEVILLE (O.S.) Where's Matthias? Where does he stay?  Figure does not move. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs.   NEVILLE  I always ask, and I always get the same answer (beat)  Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay?   MED. CLOSE SHOT - FIGURE IN CHAIR  As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder.     NEVILLE (O.S.)  6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two.  Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying  from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues.  DISSOLVE TO:  FADE IN:  LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET  He walks, one hand in pocket, a sten gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.     NEVILLE You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town.  CUT TO:  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT  He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back.   NEVILLE  The Officers club is closed, isn't it?  Permanent undress is the correct uniform.  CUT TO: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE  Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN.  CUT TO:  LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE  Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his sten gun is in his right hand.  MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE   THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.  CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE  He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.   MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN  This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN  This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.  It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW  He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT  as Neville whirls, sten gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.   MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA  These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT.  WE SEE the ""manikins"" mouth open In horror.  MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA  Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes Into the shadows of the store.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.  He stands thus for's long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.   NEVILLE  Wait...come back...wait...  Youre real! Youre not...  LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE  Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs.   MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING  He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store.  MED. SHOT EXT. STORE  This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focussed on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.  SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK  In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH  He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.   NEVILLE  Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much?  Then his head comes up. He has control again.   NEVILLE No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home.  He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed.  DISSOLVE TO:  CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER  CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, sten gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE  He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound.  CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY  Sign reads ""Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime""   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle. MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE  MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR  This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an ""authentic"" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine  MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW   MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS  His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks.   VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK  Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches.  MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES  We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.   NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT   From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member.   MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK  From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK hood flaring behind, arms outstretched CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION  MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE  bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack,  MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS  Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping. MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE  Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood.  FADE OUT.  SLOW FADE IN:  As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance,  TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As  he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.           MATTHIAS-  ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask  you to look at him. Does he have  the Marks? Do you see them?  (muffled answers  of ""no, no."")  You see him as we were before the  Punishment, before we gained grace.  You see lying there, the last of  scientists and bankers and business-  men...the users of the wheel! Do  we use the tools of the wheel, as  he does?  (""no, not."")  Is he of The Family?  (""no, not"")  Is he of the Sacred Society?  (no, not."")  Then ... what is he?  (confused mumbling,  anger)  CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE's POINT OF VIEW  WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low. He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.  LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW  Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks.   MATTHIAS (O.S.) He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric  circuitry about him. He is obsolete... ( ...yes, yes."")  WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING  Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.    MATTHIAS  And what shall we do with old machinery...?  ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW He points at Neville.  MATTHIAS  ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past...  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud.   NEVILLE This is a bloody Halloween party... Youre all sick ... You need...  Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him.   MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS  He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit.   MATTHIAS How hard it is to admit the truth. (beat)  Take him to the little room. For the Questioning... MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room.   MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE  This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp.   MATTHIAS  Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION  Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane.   NEVILLE So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all?  MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room.   MATTHIAS Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand.   NEVILLE (surly) I'm getting along...   MATTHIAS You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility.    NEVILLE Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure... Matthias turns on him angrily.  MATTHIAS Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor?  REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE    NEVILLE I tried. There was a crash...  TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE,     MATTHIAS It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So Ive turned that curse into a blessing.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION   MATTHIAS (O.S.) No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you.   NEVILLE You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that?  CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS  (angrily) last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us.    TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS  OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet.   NEVILLE I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me...   MATTHIAS He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks...   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE   NEVILLE What is the Punishment? The Marks?  WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY  As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city.   SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS  As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family.   MATTHIAS  (quietly) These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us...  CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks.   MATTHIAS In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work...   PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous...  Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry.   NEVILLE (O.S.) So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning.   PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly.     MATTHIAS You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE    NEVILLE  You'll play hell...   CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever.   As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent.  Matthias turns to Zachary.   MATTHIAS Brother Zachary?   ZACHARY We got everything ready.   MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC.  An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him.   MATTHIAS  One thing, Neville, now that its over...  Neville stares back at him.   MATTHIAS  why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...?   NEVILLE  I wasnt sure about that ... until now.   MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART  On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre.  CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville.   CLOSE SHOT - HANDS  trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white.   MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE  over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely.   LONG SHOT - THE CROWD  filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW.   CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE  who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught.   MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW   MATTHIAS  Here Is evil...  MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM  MATTHIAS to NEVILLE.    MATTHIAS  Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this (pointing to Neville)  Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse?  As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Nevilles death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the  past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light.   MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY  falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses.   MATTHIAS  (surprised)  What...?   NED. LONG - CROWD SCENE  Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights.   CLOSE SHOT - FAMILY MEMBER   writhing on ground in agony.   MATTHIAS (O S.) Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark!  NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER  stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium.  NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER  trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness.   WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM  Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out.

Search the Corridors...  the storerooms...everywhere... CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE  Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric  torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind  him, between lockers he HEARS:   LISA (O.S.) All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight... (beat) Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When I want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around.  Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence.  MED.

FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G.   LISA  Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high.  Like they were going to crucify you.   CLOSE - NEVILLE  looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind, WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch.   NEVILLE As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them?  Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied,  and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville.    LISA  We've got a reason,  Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her.    NEVILLE  My name is Robert...   LISA  Your name's mud, Mister.

She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring  into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect.   LISA  ...and youre not going to need  a name if you fool with me again.  She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk.   NEVILLE Where did you pick up that cute  way of saying stop?  WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors.   LISA  Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow,  I only said slow. You know how I  say stop?  The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking.   NEVILLE  You keep clowning around, and those  spooks out there are going to...

REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW  As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes.

MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA  Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting.  LISA  okay... stop, Open it up.  They are standing near a utility room.

CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards  from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are APPEARING. We HEAR the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they APPEAR, Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding LIGHT.

You've only seen the tertiary cases ... Were primary, you see.  Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague.    DUTCH When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang.   NEVILLE And you?   DUTCH Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Richie's going. He's advanced secondary.  GROUP SHOT - AT DOOR OF BEDROOM A girl comes out. LISA How is he? GIRL (shaking head)  No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. Hesalmost white.  Lisa shakes her head.

They look down to see a BOY lying on bed, tossing. His skin Is light- not dead white, but very light--though his features are African. His hair is natural, but also light His eyes, when he opens them, are white, but only iris is missing. Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him.

SERIES OF SHOT - NEVILLE AND RICHIE  He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc.   DUTCH (O.S.) He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes.    NEVILLE (still examining Richie) So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely.   CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH  DUTCH I've seen them go over before. I almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning.

Dutch shrugs, looks At Neville steadily.  DUTCH  Why doctor, I did like you do. I killed the son of a bitch.  LISA (insistently)  Listen, if the Masonic rites are over, how about Richie?  Neville rises and they walk INTO NEXT ROOM. Other KIDS sit around reading, playing guitar, eating.  NEVILLE  We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what I need there.  LISA (scornfully) Is there anything you can do, Doctor? Youve lost  200 million patients already.  Neville studies her a moment.   NEVILLE I don't have it.   LISA Have what? Time, a care?  NEVILLE  I don't have the plague. I'm immune.  REACTION SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS Even Lisa looks awed. Dutch frowns, confused.  DUTCH Everybody...has it NEVILLE (quietly) Everybody but me.

You remember that place where there was light? The place where the creeps all came at night trying to bring it down?   RICHIE  Yeah, sure...  LISA  This is it. This is Neville. He's ...the landlord, I guess. (slyly)  Richie eases back, somewhat reassured.  RICHIE How sick is he?  Lisa smiles sardonically at Neville.  LISA He isnt hardly sick at all, honey. Maybe just a little spooked once in a while.  He's going to get you well.  RICHIE Well, hell. You know there aint no way...  NEVILLE I'm going to try. What have you got-to loose?  Richie smiles up at him. RICHIE Nothin' man. Not a thing. You go it, hear?   LISA He will, baby. He will.  VERY CLOSE SHOT - MICROSCOPIC SLIDE  on the slide we SEE CELLS being attached and destroyed by other cells.    NEVILLE (O.S.) I dont know how much it will take. Ill draw blood as often as I can. Well just have to keep pumping it to him.   LISA (O S.) (tired) How long do you think it will take?   NEVILLE (O.S.)  How do I know? Maybe it wont work at all...  Who do you think I am, Louis Pasteur?   VERY CLOSE SHOT - LISAS FACE  WE NOTICE that she is a little lighter than in past scenes. Streaking in her hair should now be somewhat noticeable.   LISA  But its a chance...   MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE  He looks up from microscope.   NEVILLE  Yeah, and it ought to be your chance. You need this stuff, too.  TWO-SHOT  LISA  Not as bad as he does. And anyhow, he's my brother...  Neville studies her a moment.   NEVILLE That's why he is getting it first. (beat)  And if it works, you understand what that should mean, don't you?  Lisa looks puzzled.   LISA What?    NEVILLE Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when thats done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there...    MED. SHOT - LISA  She is listening, but her expression shows that she is preoccupied with other thoughts. Neville has left workbench and walks across apartment. Lisa walks with him. They stop near liquor cabinet.   NEVILLE (O.S.) A whole world. Vines, fields that will grow anything we want to plant. Streams full of fish again. Stands of timber...   LISA You sound almost...    NEVILLE Almost what?   LISA Almost glad that it ... happened.  CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT  Neville pours a drink, mixes one for Lisa. He looks up coldly, almost angrily.    NEVILLE I'm not glad, but Im not moaning, either. I told them in Biowar, you people are crazy. This kind of research...  (breaks off) ...Ah, why do you think I was a colonel instead of a lieutenant general?   LISA  Now they know.   NEVILLE No, they dont know a goddamned thing. They're dead. We know.  (beat)  Forget it. Its not worth our time.  He takes off lab coat, climbs into coveralls, gets sten gun, belt with flashlight, grenades, etc. He cocks sten gun, checks pouch for ammo, checks flashlight.

CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE WAVING FROM ELEVATOR - LISA'S POV  REVERSE SHOT - LISA  She looks sad, subdued tears in her eyes.  EXT. PLAZA - DAY  empty and the fountain splashes untended. We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower.  GIRL Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please.  She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain.  VERY CLOSE HAND WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLE CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE is injecting Richie with serum. The boy is unconscious, mumbling deliribusly.    RICHIE  ...got to move fast, keep on moving. That Matthias,  he wants you. All the cops want' I you. They gonna  get you, boy, they gonna make you come over, you hear?

This is his best chance.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING INTO MAIN APT.   NEVILLE If there were time, I'd have trapped one of Matthias' things and tried the serum on it.  Lisa bristles at this.   LISA What do you mean ""things Arent they human, too?  NEVILLE Yeah ... I guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they?  LISA They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race?   NEVILLE Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it.   LISA  Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about.  NEVILLE No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this (points to his collection of cultural artifacts) That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, ""Well ... maybe it was worth it.""  LISA I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT!  NEVILLE Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard THAT kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right? (more)  NEVILLE (CONTID) You can found a Panther cell, and I can start up a White Citizens Council! Or shall I be the SDS and you can be the whole damn Harvard faculty?! Too bad we don't have enough folks around to do the United Nations over, isn't it!  CLOSE - LISA  She is boiling, but holds her control. She speaks quietly, matter-of-factly.  LISA Neville, you are a bastard. A class-A bastard.   MED. SHOT - LISA WALKING TOWARD DOOR   NEVILLE (O.S.) Where are you headed?  Lisa stops, turns.  LISA I know it doesn't mean much to you, but it happens this is an anniversary. Two years ago today, all those no-good people you just wrote off, died in this town. I've got a mother and father Richie and I buried with our own hands out there, after the Army stopped burning the bodies. Id like to go visit them, if it's all right with you!  Neville studies her for a long moment.  NEVILLE Sure, it's all right.  He tosses her something below CAMERA RANGE as he speaks.  NEVILLE Take this with you.

The graves are overgrown, some of the stones fallen. The place is in general disrepair.  MED. SHOT - LISA AND GRAVE  She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neckdown. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents:  Richard and Lorena McNally Born, Montgomery, Alabama Died, Los Angeles, California 1977  In front of the marker are a couple of tin coffee cans with the remains of long-wilted flowers in them.   VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE  She stands for a moment, silent, near tears. Then she speaks in a low, almost conversational tone.   LISA Listen, I know I don't come like I should. But it's hard times, momma, daddy. You never knew what hard times was. You only thought you did.  Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the sten gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing.   MED. LONG SHOT - CRYPT LISAS POV  Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for.   CLOSE - LISA  She slowly approaches crypt, gun ready, a little on edge, curious.   VOICE (O.S.)  Oh, God ... oh...  Lisa stops as she HEARS this MOAN, then moves cautiously around to front of crypt. The door is ajar slightly. Again, like Neville, after a pause, she kicks door OPEN, jumps past it, glancing inside.   MED.

Lisa pulls UP, parks the car, and gets out slowly, carrying her gun listlessly. She is absorbed in thought, stops a little behind Neville on the far side of fountain. She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain.   NEVILLE It's an illusion, you know. It looks like a tapped spring, but theres nothing new ... the same water coming up over and over again...  Lisa says nothing.  NEVILLE He's better.

As she continues, his expression changes to one of compassion.   LISA (O.S.)  Because one of them was a dead baby  Stillborn, like all of them. And  the other one was its mother.

LIVING ROOM   -   NIGHT.    ALBERT, a middle-aged man, feeds MELVIN, a two-year-old.    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)  I loved my father and he taught me  many useful things. But he didn't  teach me anything at all about  women. There was a time when I  resented that. And then, one day,  it occurred to me that perhaps he  didn't know all that much about  the fairer sex.    On the other side of the room, CORINNE, a vulgar,  morbidly obese woman, sits on the couch and devours a  large packet of potato chips.    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)  One look at my mother and I had  conclusive proof.    She burps loudly and gives a smile of satisfaction.      EXT.   EAST PERTH STREETS    -    PRESENT DAY.    MELVIN, now thirty-two, walks along with MIKE, three.  Both are bespectacled.    MELVIN  Here's what I'm going to do, son.  I'll give it to you straight. I'm  not going to fill your head with  stories about fictitious characters  like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny  or God. There's only one thing you  need to worry about in this life and  that's women. And I'm going to  teach you everything I know about  the art of meeting, courting and  seducing 'em. Don't worry about  anything else, there's nothing more  important. Reading, writing, toilet  training you can learn later in life.  2.    INT.   DEPARTMENT STORE   -   DAY.    Mike, wearing cute denim overalls with a teddy bear  embroidered on the front, stands on a footstool in front  of Melvin and a TAILOR.    MELVIN  Clothes maketh or unmaketh the man.  What were you thinking when you put  that on this morning? That you were  going to spend the day in the sandpit?    Mike responds with a look of innocence and confusion.    MELVIN  (to tailor)  We'll take the best you've got.  (to Mike)  The finer the threads, the more  inclined the ladies will be to tear  them off. I know, don't try to make  sense of their logic. They have none.      EXT.   CAFE   -   DAY.    Melvin at a table with Mike, who is now dressed in smart  casual attire and looks more like his father.    MELVIN  Of course, it's not all about clothes.  It's the way you carry yourself too.  You've gotta make a conscious effort  to be relaxed but in control in all  situations. And a little playful.  Go for an expression where you're  suppressing mild amusement. But  don't overdo it. You want to look  dignified at all times.    Melvin glances over to Mike, who is picking his nose.    MELVIN  Damnit, son! Are you not listening  to a word I say?    Mike freezes, unsure what to do, his finger still planted  in his nostril. Melvin yanks it out.  3.    EXT.   PRESCHOOL    -       DAY.    Melvin and Mike approach the entrance.    MELVIN  Now meeting the right person is  really all about spending enough  time in the right places. So we're  going to a new preschool today. One  in a higher socioeconomic suburb.      EXT.   PLAYGROUND       -    DAY.    Melvin and Mike sit on a bench and watch children at play.    MELVIN  Well?    Mike looks around then points.    MELVIN  You like the girl over there?    Mike nods. She's MOLLY, three. A shy, bespectacled  girl, she sits on her own and reads a book.    MELVIN  Uh ... yeah. I think there's enough  geek genes in our family. It's time  to diversify.    Elsewhere, BRITTANY, four, is taunting another child.    MELVIN  And avoid that bitchy girl. She may  be pretty but believe me, it's not  worth the trouble. You definitely  don't want to get involved with  someone like your mother.    Melvin keeps looking. He points out AMELIE, three,  well-dressed and eating a baguette.    MELVIN  Stay away from the French girl too.  French women have no morals.  4.    MELVIN  It might be great for a bit of slap  and tickle after midnight when the  only meat your buddies are getting  is at a kebab shop. But there's no  word in French for ""fidelity"" and  what we're looking for is a serious  relationship. I mean, what you're  looking for.  (awkwardly unconvincing)  I'm fine.    SARAH, three, blonde and dressed in pink, sits at a table  nearby. She talks excitedly with a group of girls.    MELVIN  She's popular, good-looking. She  seems friendly enough. I think  Barbie there might be worth a try.    Mike doesn't look so sure.    MELVIN  Go and talk to her.    Intimidated, Mike shakes his head, his eyes pleading.    MELVIN  C'mon! It's better to get shot  down than wonder ""What if?""    Melvin gives him a push in Sarah's direction.    MELVIN  Just show an interest in the things  that interest her and you'll have  plenty to talk about.    Mike, looking completely out of place in his flashy  clothes, apprehensively approaches the girls. They stop  talking and watch him.    He picks up Sarah's handbag and admires it, putting it  over his shoulder. Then he tries on her sun hat and  slips into her discarded pink shoes. The girls laugh at  him and run away.    Melvin covers his face in disbelief.  5.    A MOMENT LATER.    Back on the bench, Melvin scolds Mike.    MELVIN  Would you like to go to the toyshop  later on? You can pick out a nice  fairy costume. What are you doing  to me, boy?!    Mike shrugs defensively.    MELVIN  We need to toughen up your image now.  Most girls are attracted to bad boys.  See if you can start some sort of  altercation with her. Understand?    Mike thinks, then nods his head.      A MOMENT LATER.    Mike grabs a handful of sand from the sandpit, marches up  to Sarah and throws it forcefully into her face. Sarah  starts to cry, drawing the attention of everyone in the  playground. Mike smiles and looks to his father for  approval. Melvin is horrified.      INT.   FLORIST    -   DAY.    Mike struggles with a large arrangement of flowers.  Melvin pays the FLORIST.    MELVIN  Well that was over the top but at  least you got her attention. And  it's better to be known as a jerk  rather than a fruitcake. The good  news is you now have the opportunity  to apologise. If you can feign  sincerity and a desperation for  forgiveness, you should be able to  endear yourself to her.  (to florist)  Leave the price tag on. We want  her to know how much we paid.  6.    EXT.   PLAYGROUND    -   DAY.    Melvin watches from the other side of the high fence.  Mike carries the flowers across the playground.    He sees Sarah being comforted by her friends.         Then he  sees Molly, who is still reading her book.    Melvin gestures for Mike to give the flowers to Sarah.  Mike thinks, then gives them to Molly instead.    Melvin groans and throws his hands up in frustration.      EXT.   CARPARK   -   DAY.    Melvin points his finger in Mike's face.    MELVIN  I'm trying to do the right thing  by you and you mess everything up!  You're as incompetent as ... the  government film funding bodies!    MARY, early thirties and attractive, approaches with  Molly, who carries the flowers.    MARY  Molly loves her flowers.      Thank you.    Melvin's attitude changes immediately.    MELVIN  Oh.   No problem. They were my idea.    MARY  Well it was a very nice gesture.    She continues walking, then stops.    MARY  We're going to lunch at the cafe on  the corner. Would you and Mike like  to join us?    MELVIN  Absolutely.      We'll see you there.    Mary and Molly leave.       Melvin turns back to Mike.  7.    MELVIN  Great work my friend! Looks like  we're in for a double date.    He claps a high five with his son.    MELVIN  And the perfect chance for you to  learn from a master at work.      INT.   CAFE ON THE CORNER      -   DAY.    Melvin, Mike, Mary and Molly sit around a table. Before  eating, Mary and Molly bow their heads in prayer. Mike  watches them and does the same.    Unseen by the others, Melvin decides to give thanks too.  And not for the food in front of him.      EXT.   PARK   -   DAY.    Melvin and Mary sit and watch their children laugh as  they chase each other about.    MARY  They seem to like each other.    MELVIN  They certainly do.    MARY  Molly has a birthday party coming  up. Would you like to come?    MELVIN  Absolutely.    MARY  I'm thinking about a sleepover?  Or is it too soon?    She smiles at him.       Melvin raises an eyebrow seductively.    MELVIN  A ""sleepover"" would be great. No  such thing as ""too soon"" when you're  with the right person.  8.    He moves closer to Mary. He puts one hand on her leg and  uses the other to play with her hair. She pulls away  violently and stands.    MARY  What are you doing?!    MELVIN  Getting to know you. Before the  ""sleepover"".    MARY  I meant Mike coming over to spend  the night. Not his Dad.    MELVIN  Oh.    Unimpressed, she walks over to Molly, lifts her into her  arms and they leave. Mike stares coldly at his father,  his hands on his hips.      EXT.   BUS STOP   -   DAY.    Mike picks flowers from a nearby garden. Melvin sits  alone, dejected. Mike approaches and whispers in his ear.    MELVIN  It's better to get shot down than  wonder ""What if?""?    Mike whispers more.    MELVIN  I now have the opportunity to  apologise and endear myself to her?    Mike presents his father with a small arrangement of  hand-picked flowers. Melvin thinks.    MELVIN  Yeah! Yeah, you're right.   I've  taught you well!    He takes the flowers, leans over and kisses his boy  fondly on the head.    FADE OUT."""

WIDER ANGLE:  Eyes glisten in the clock's shine,        patiently watching the time.        BZZZZ!  The ALARM SOUNDS.  A hand that's been hovering        over the clock drops.  Silence.  JAKE HOYT, a fit young        man, rolls over, throws an arm over his sleeping wife --                                JAKE                  It's time.        -- she's not there, just empty blankets.  He sits up.        HIS POV        LISA, his wife, in a rocking chair in the corner.        BACK TO SCENE        Jake is surprised.  How'd she sneak off?                                JAKE                  What are you doing up?        She pulls back the blanket, she breast-feeds their infant        daughter.                                LISA                  Mooooo.

KITCHEN - DAWN        Jake, scrubbed, shaved, in T-shirt and jeans, studies the        gleaming badge, snaps it in its case, clips it to his        belt.  He tosses a duffle on the counter.  Searches        through the police gear.  Lisa taps a police baton on his        shoulder.  He takes it.                                JAKE                  Thanks.

He grabs his duffle and pressed uniform off a chair.  He        kisses Lisa's cheek, her neck, her lips.  Heads to the        door.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jake stops.  Lisa answers.                                LISA                  Hello?                         (beat, laughs)                  Hi!  How nice, thank you.

And I know                  it's ninety percent bullshit but                  it's entertaining.  That's why I                  read it.  Because it entertains                  me.  If you won't let me read my                  paper, then entertain me with your                  bullshit.  Tell me a story.

All over the median.  So I light                  it up and hit the wailer.  Guy                  drives on like I'm invisible for                  ten blocks before he pulls over.                  Plates ran clean.  I approach.                  Debbie covers.  Driver's this huge                  white guy.  Can barely keep his                  eyes open.  I field test and                  arrest and I'm belting him in our                  unit.  Debbie's tossing his car.                  She calls me to the vehicle and                  shows me a snubbed .38 and two                  shotguns, all loaded and locked.                                ALONZO                  No shit?                                JAKE                  No shit.  She calls our supervisor                  and I keep searching.  I find five                  hundred grams of meth in the dash.                  Turns out our D.U.I. was on bail                  for distribution.  He was on his                  way to smoke his ex-partner before                  trial.                         (proudly)                  We prevented a murder.        Alonzo is astonished.                                ALONZO                  ... amazing...        Jake beams -- some story, huh?                                ALONZO                  You're driving around the Valley                  with a fine bitch in your car for                  a year and the most entertaining                  story you got is a D.U.I. stop?                  Never hit her up for some Code X                  in the back seat?                                JAKE                  I have a wife.                                ALONZO                  You also have a dick.        Alonzo shakes his head in disgust.  Jake is crushed.                                ALONZO                  Let's go.        Alonzo tosses a twenty on the table.  OFF his heavy        wedding band we:                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY        Jake and Alonzo crossing.  Alonzo sizes Jake up, smirks        at his dorky running shoes.                                ALONZO                  You look, walk and talk like a                  cop.  Grow your hair out.        Alonzo stops at:        G-RIDE        A narc-machine supreme.  A tired, candy blue 1978 Monte        Carlo with mismatched rims, curb feelers, window tint.                                ALONZO                  Gimme that menu.        Jake pulls a Chinese menu from under the wiper.  Hands it        to Alonzo, who folds and pockets it.                                ALONZO                  Get in.  S'un1ocked.        Jake's turn to smirk as he climbs in.        INT. G-RIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        Jake buries his shoes in beer cans and coffee cups.  He        notes a car seat in back.  Alonzo twists a screwdriver in        the shattered ignition, pumps the hell out of the gas.        After forever, the ENGINE CATCHES -- VROOM!                                JAKE                  This is a piece'a shit.                                ALONZO                  Don't worry.  My baby puts out                  when she has to.        Alonzo rubs the dash lovingly and backs out.                                JAKE                  Where's the office?                                ALONZO                  You're in it.        Jake reacts.  Then smiles -- This is kind'a cool.                                ALONZO                  Rover's in the glove box.  Wanna                  ten-eight us?                                JAKE                  Yessir.                                ALONZO                  Shitcan the sirs.  I'm not your                  domestic violence awareness                  instructor.        Jake takes a Motorola radio from the glove box.                                JAKE                  What's our I.D.?                                ALONZO                  Nora fifteen.                                JAKE                         (into Motorola)                  Nora fifteen, ten-eight.                                DISPATCH (V.O.)                  Nora fifteen, ten-twenty.        Jake checks the street signs -- Virgil and Raymond.        Before he can tell Dispatch, Alonzo snatches the        Motorola.                                ALONZO                         (into rover)                  Nora fifteen, South on Rampart at                  6th.                                DISPATCH (V.O.)                  Ten four.        Alonzo SQUEALS out of the lot, tosses Jake the rover.                                ALONZO                  Bad guys are listening.  Don't                  trust the radios.  Never let                  anyone know where you're really                  at.  Ever.        Jake nods and smiles -- makes sense.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        Heading South on Alvarado, passing MacArthur Park.  It        could be San Salvador or Guatemala City.  Jake is        mesmerized by the crowds.                                JAKE                  This looks like the Third World.                                ALONZO                  It's my world.        Alonzo lights a smoke.  Settles in his seat.                                ALONZO                  Today's a training day.  Gonna                  show you around, give you a feel                  for the business.  I have thirty-                  eight cases pending trial.  I have                  sixty-three active investigations.                  There's another three hundred and                  fifty cases on the log I can't                  clear.  I'm supervising five                  officers.  That's five different                  personalities, five different sets                  of problems.  You, Officer Hoyt,                  if you got the guts to succeed,                  will be number six.  I don't have                  time to baby-sit or hold hands.                  You have one day to show me who                  you are and what you can or cannot                  handle.  You can't hack narcotics,                  feel free to work a pussy desk                  pinching check kiters.  Hear me,                  Officer Hoyt?                                JAKE                  I hear you.                                ALONZO                  Good.  Gonna show you reality.                  Think you can handle it?                                JAKE                  Yeah.                                ALONZO                  Why you wanna be a narc?                                JAKE                  I want to serve my community by                  ridding it of dangerous drugs.        Alonzo gives him a look -- Don't b.s. me.                                JAKE                  I wanna make detective.        The boy is ambitious.  Alonzo likes that.                                ALONZO                  Stick with me and you will.  If                  you can unlearn the bullshit                  they've filled your head with.                  You gonna be passing out baseball                  cards and carrying old ladies'                  groceries like the rest of the                  newfucks Washington's flooded the                  streets with?                                JAKE                  Sergeant, I'll do anything you                  want me to do.                                ALONZO                  Stand by, because narcotics ain't                  about staying in the car and                  looking good.  I bet you write                  great paper, Hoyt.                         (before Jake can answer)                  You do.  I checked it out.  Cover                  your area, cover your ass, but not                  necessarily in that order, right?                                JAKE                  Right.  Are you going to teach me                  that old school hard-charging beat                  up everything that moves Rodney                  King shit?                                ALONZO                  That's not police work either.                  We're the new breed.  We use                  this...                         (taps his head)                  This is our tool.        Alonzo stops at a light.  A shiny new police cruiser        pulls alongside.  The driver sips a Big Gulp, his female        partner writes a report.  They look more like co-eds than        cops.        Jake eyes the driver.  Who gives him a smile.  Then        Alonzo looks at the driver.  When their eyes meet, the        Driver looks away, intimidated, and makes a right turn.        Alonzo grins at Jake, his point underscored.                                ALONZO                  How long you been married?                                JAKE                  A year.                                ALONZO                  Gotta kid, right?                                JAKE                         (smiles)                  A nine-month-old girl.                                ALONZO                  I got four kids.  All boys.  You                  want a son, lemme know.  I'll do                  your old lady up.  I can't miss.        Jake angers, though he knows he is being tested.                                JAKE                  Let's not talk about my family.                                ALONZO                  It's cool.  I can respect that.                  I'm married.  I have my queen,                  too.  I remember what it's like to                  have a pretty young bride.  Bet                  you still fuck her face-to-face.                                JAKE                         (clenched teeth)                  Can we not talk about my wife?                                ALONZO                  Kick back, kid... You're so in                  love it's comin' out your eyes.                  The day you bring the old lady to                  the office is the day you don't go                  home.  If you don't hide your love                  deep inside, the maggots are gonna                  find it and chew on it.        Jake realizes Alonzo is right.  Alonzo hands him a card.                                ALONZO                  That's our Chaplain, Lieutenant                  Hayes.  Give him a call.  Invite                  him and his wife over for dinner.                  He's a good guy and no dumbshit.                  You and your woman need any kind'a help,                  call him.  I'm serious.        Jake takes the card.  Kind of smiles.                                JAKE                  Thanks.  I will.        They cruise a beat.                                JAKE                  Who's Mr. Clean?        Alonzo nails him with surprised look.                                ALONZO                  Where the hell you hear that?                                JAKE                  From a Van Nuys Robbery Detective.                  Told me to ask you that.                                ALONZO                         (smiles, shakes his head)                  Asshole.        Alonzo pulls onto a street of dense apartments.  Parks        along the curb.                                JAKE                  What's here?                                ALONZO                  Transactions...  See the                  Salvatrucha one-cut on the fence,                  trying not to look like he's                  slangin'?        Jake looks, sees a young, bald cholo, Neto, just hanging        out.                                ALONZO                  That's Neto.  Works for me.                                JAKE                  Informant?                                ALONZO                  I got eyes everywhere.  He gets to                  peddle reefer, make a little cash                  for the family.  I get a heads up                  when shit goes down.  The barrio                  on-line.                                JAKE                  And you trust him?                                ALONZO                  Fuckin' right I trust him.  Sprung                  his mom from I.N.S. detention.        Alonzo watches his mirror, perks up.                                ALONZO                  Here we go.        INSERT - MIRROR        A new VW Beetle pulls onto the street, moving slow.        BACK TO SCENE        The VW passes the G-Ride.  Jake glimpses three people        inside, two guys in front, a girl in back.  Hipster        university students.                                ALONZO                  Shit's going down.        JAKE'S POV        The VW stops.  Neto looks around, crosses to the driver's        window, a drink cup in hand.  Neto plucks a foil pack        from the cup.  Trades it for the driver's ten.  Neto        walks away.        BACK TO SCENE                                ALONZO                  See the hand-to-hand?                                JAKE                  I saw it.        The VW drives off, fast.  Alonzo pulls out.  Follows it.                                ALONZO                  When was your last felony stop?                                JAKE                  Couple weeks ago.                                ALONZO                  You need practice.                                JAKE                  They look like college kids.                                ALONZO                  They need a lesson.  I want these                  hemorrhoids grabbing glass.  I got                  front.  You got back.        Alonzo pulls his gun.  Jake reaches for the Motorola.                                ALONZO                  Stay off the rover.        Jake puts it away, pulls his gun.        Alonzo stomps the gas.  The G-Ride HOWLS.        The VW is at the corner, about to turn --        SCREEEEEECH! -- Alonzo slaloms to a stop, blocking its        path.  His pistol aimed through Jake's window at the        DRIVER.                                ALONZO                  Police!  Lemme see your hands!        Jake draws a bead on the girl in back.                                JAKE                  Police officers!  Your hands!        The kids gawk at the two narcs for a stunned beat.                                JAKE                  Don't look at us!  Look straight                  ahead!                                ALONZO                  Driver and right front passenger!                  Palms on the windshield!                                JAKE                  You in the back!  Palms on the                  side window!  Look straight ahead!                                ALONZO                  Driver!  Use your left hand, put                  the vehicle in park.        The Driver is mortified because:                                DRIVER                  ... it's a stickshift...                                ALONZO                  Shut up, dickhead!  I'll shoot                  your face off!  Take the keys out                  of the ignition.  Throw 'em out                  the window!        The Driver does, quickly, as Alonzo jumps from the car        charges the Driver, shoves the gun in his face.  These        are just scared kids.  The girl tries not to cry.                                ALONZO                  Fork it over, smartman.                                DRIVER                  What, sir?        Alonzo grabs his ear, tugs violently.                                ALONZO                  The fuckin' marijuana I just                  watched you purchase!        The Driver hands over the foil pack.                                PASSENGER                  I'm very sorry, sir.  I didn't                  know he was bringing me here.                                ALONZO                  Shut up, dumbass.  You're here                  now!  Gimme that pipe!        There's a pot pipe on the floor mat.  The PASSENGER picks        it up.  Reluctantly hands it to Alonzo.                                PASSENGER                  My mom gave me that pipe.                                ALONZO                  What else you got?                                DRIVER                  Cigarettes...?                                ALONZO                  Gimme those too.        He gives him a squished packed of Marlboro reds.  The        girl lowers her hands -- bad move.                                ALONZO                  Control your suspect, Hoyt!                                JAKE                  Miss!  Palms on the glass!        Alonzo sees her lip quiver.                                ALONZO                  Cry and I slap the eyes outta your                  face!        Back to the Driver.                                ALONZO                  You aware this is a gang                  neighborhood?        That gives him pause -- no kidding -- Alonzo grabs his        ear again, shakes.                                ALONZO                  I see you here again, I take your                  car.  You can walk home while your                  girlfriend pulls a homeboy                  train... Hear me, reefer addict?                                DRIVER                  Yes, sir.                                ALONZO                  Thank you for your cooperation --                  Safe your iron.        Jake holsters his gun.  Follows Alonzo to the G-Ride.        ON VW        The kids trade shell-shocked looks, grabbing glass.  Then        lower their hands.        ON G-RIDE        Alonzo and Jake climb in.  As they drive away, the gir1        nails Jake with a look of revulsion.  Jake reacts.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        Alonzo laughing.  Jake didn't like what happened.  It        shows.                                JAKE                  Was that training?  How to roust                  students for dime bags?                                ALONZO                  They have no business being here.                  Sooner or later that little smart-                  ass white boy college puke is                  gonna get jacked.  I saved his                  life.                                JAKE                  Taught him a real lesson.                                ALONZO                  Sure did, buy your shit on campus.                         (beat)                  I like your moves.  Someone                  trained you well.        Jake smiles to himself.  Alonzo opens the foil, sniffs --                                ALONZO                  Shitty dime.  Check it out.        -- hands it to Jake.  Who takes out a bud.                                ALONZO                  See the small hairs?  The                  undeveloped seeds.  How it's all                  stems?        Jake nods.                                ALONZO                  It was picked immature.  See how                  flat it is?  Classic brick-pack                  Mexican.  See how brittle it is?                  It's not bud season.  It's from                  last year.        Jake is amazed.  Alonzo snatches the bud, crumbles it in        the pipe, tosses aside seeds.                                ALONZO                  To be truly effective, a narcotics                  detective must know and love                  narcotics.  A good narcotics                  detective should have narcotics in                  his blood.                                JAKE                  You going to smoke that?        Alonzo smiles devilishly, offers Jake the pipe.                                ALONZO                  You are.                                JAKE                  Hell if I am.                                ALONZO                  What?  You a Mormon?  A Jesus freak?                                JAKE                  No.  I'm not losing my job.                                ALONZO                         (re: the pipe)                  This is your job.                                JAKE                  I can't do it.                                ALONZO                  This isn't some kind of test.                  Take a fuckin' hit.                                JAKE                  I became a cop to keep people from                  using that poison.                                ALONZO                         (laughs)                  This ain't a review board.  We                  ain't doing rails.  Just leafy                  green bud.        Jake stands firm, shaking his head.        SCREECH!  Alonzo stops in the middle of the street, pulls        his gun, jams it in Jake's ear.  CARS behind them HONK.                                ALONZO                  If I was a dealer, you'd be dead.                  Turn shit down on the street and                  the Chief hands your wife a                  crisply folded flag.        Jake stares stubbornly at Alonzo.  Alonzo pockets the        gun.  Lights the lighter.  And takes a huge hit, blows        smoke in Jake's face.                                ALONZO                  I don't want you in my unit.  Not                  even my division.  Go back to                  Valley.  Get the fuck out of my                  car.        A staring contest.  Jake decides to play the game.                                JAKE                  ... Okay...        He takes the pipe, takes an absolutely huge hit --                                ALONZO                  Alright.  That's how it's done,                  son.        -- And is racked with a spasm of coughing.                                ALONZO                  Betrayed by your virgin lungs.        Jake takes another hit -- a passing driver watches --        blows the smoke in Alonzo's face.        Alonzo laughs, resumes driving, takes a hit.  They pass        the pipe around a few times before Alonzo tosses it on        the dash.                                ALONZO                  It's cashed.        They cruise in a strange otherworldly silence.  Jake is        clearly messed up, his head lolls from side to side.                                ALONZO                  Shit, you took some mansized hits.                  You gonna be okay?  When's the                  last time you smoked out?                                JAKE                  ... Twelfth grade...                                ALONZO                  Left that out of your service                  jacket.  Knew you had secrets,                  everyone does.  Didn't know you                  dig dusters.                                JAKE                  What are dusters?                                ALONZO                  You know, dusted bud.  Dippers?                  C'mon, dipped in P.C.P.  Primos.                  Sherm, Kool, P-dog, Angel dust...                  Didn't you smell it?  Taste it?                                JAKE                         (horrified)                  ... I've never done it...                                ALONZO                  Now you have.  Remember the smell                  for next time.  Think I'd inhale                  that shit?        Jake is scared as hell, pale, sweaty.                                JAKE                  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.                                ALONZO                  Gonna kick the shit out of Neto.                  Motherfucker's lacing crappy bud                  to get that unsuspecting return                  client.  Hell with his mom, I'm                  deporting the bitch.                                JAKE                  I'm gonna get piss tested.  I'm                  gonna get fired.                                ALONZO                  I told you, Lieutenant's got our                  backs.  We know a week before we                  piss.                                JAKE                         (panicking)                  Shit.  How could you do this to                  me?  Shit.  Shit.  Shit!        Alonzo slams an elbow across Jake's throat.                                ALONZO                  Fuckin' chill and ride the high.                  You're an adult.  You chose to                  smoke.  Live with your decisions.                  You cool?                                JAKE                  I'm cool.                                ALONZO                  Besides, no one put a gun to your                  head.        Jake shoots him a look.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. HOUSE - DAY        A well-tended craftsman on a steep hill of fixer-uppers        in Echo Park.  The G-Ride parks out front.                                ALONZO                  Get your shit together.        Alonzo and Jake cross to the door.  The steepness of the        hill is disorientating to Jake.  Alonzo knocks.                                ALONZO                  This is my Road Dog's pad.  Wanna                  see what he thinks of you.                                JAKE                  What do I say?                                ALONZO                  You'll think of something stupid.        Someone peeps through the peephole.  A tall, heavy man in        a bathrobe with long, grey hair answers.  This is ROGER,        old before his time, a little sick.  Happy to see Alonzo.                                ROGER                  Hey, brother, get your ass in                  here.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. ROGER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY        Roger and Alonzo hug.                                ALONZO                  Did I wake you?                                ROGER                  No.  C'mon in.  Please have a seat.        Alonzo and Jake sit in big chairs.  Three beepers, three        cell phones on the coffee table.  Roger sits, takes a        bottle of whisky, three tumblers from a liquor cart.        Pours booze.        Jake looks around at the modest traditional furniture.        The Hummel figurines.  Photos on the wall.                                ALONZO                  Alright.  Time to get my swerve                  on.        Roger gives Alonzo a concerned look.                                ROGER                  Heard you had a beef in Vegas.                                ALONZO                  I'm cool.  People talk shit.                                ROGER                  You know I got your back.                                ALONZO                  I know.  Thanks.        They clink glasses, chug booze.  Jake doesn't.  He stares        into the liquid, enraptured by its smoky patterns.                                ALONZO                  C'mon.  Be polite.        Jake takes his tumbler, sniffs, sips.  Winces.  Roger        runs a finger up Jake's crew-cut.  Jake recoils.                                ROGER                  Went and got yourself a daisy-                  fresh scuzz-headed rookie.        Roger leans back in the couch.  Jake is looking around        the room again.  A BEEPER BEEPS.  Roger checks it.  Dials        a cell phone.  Alonzo gesturing for Jake to drink.  He        almost empties his glass.                                ROGER                  Wassup?                         (beat)                  Collect first.  Step to that cat                  with something to flash.  He'll                  lay you down.                         (beat)                  Righteous.  Later, dude.        Roger hangs up.  Studies Jake.                                ROGER                  Jesus, Alonzo.  He's high as a                  motherfucker.  The hell you give                  him?        Alonzo tosses the foil pack on the table.  Roger takes        it, smells the PCP and shakes his head.                                ROGER                  Where'd you grow up?                                JAKE                  North Hollywood.                                ROGER                  What's your last name?                                JAKE                  Hoyt.                                ROGER                         (it clicks)                  You play strong safety for North                  Hollywood High?                                JAKE                  Yessir.  How'd you know?                                ROGER                  I follow all the good players.        His BEEPER BEEPS.  He checks it, sighs.  Dials a cell        phone.                                ROGER                  It's me.  Whassup?                         (beat)                  Can't do a thing for you.  Your                  mess.  You clean it up.  Don't be                  callin' me.        He hangs up.  Freshens the drinks.                                ROGER                         (to Jake)                  Here's a joke, boy.  One day this                  man walks out of his house to go                  to work.  He sees this snail on                  his porch.  So he picks it up and                  chucks it over his roof, into the                  back yard.  Snail bounces off a                  rock, cracks its shell all to                  shit, and lands in the grass.                  Snail lies there dying.        A BEEPER BEEPS.  Roger checks and ignores it.                                ROGER                  But it doesn't die.  It eats some                  grass.  Slowly heals.  Grows a new                  shell.  And after a while it can                  crawl again.  One day the snail up                  and heads back to the front of the                  house.  Finally, after a year, the                  little guy crawls back on the                  porch.  Right then, the man walks                  out to go to work and sees this                  snail again.  So he says to it,                  'What the fuck's your problem?'        Jake stares at Roger a beat.  Then starts laughing.        Really laughing.  Maybe too much.  He wipes his eyes.                                JAKE                  That's messed up.  That wasn't                  funny.                                ALONZO                  Then why are you cackling like a                  jackal?                                JAKE                  I dunno.                                ROGER                  Figure that joke out and you'll                  figure the streets out.                                ALONZO                  Don't listen to him.  There's                  nothing to figure out.  The                  street's nothing more than                  senseless bullshit.                                JAKE                  Uh-uh.  I got 'em figured out.                                ROGER                  You got the streets figured out?                                JAKE                  Yeah.  It's all smiles and cries.                                ALONZO                  Give up.  You're too high, space                  captain.                                ROGER                  Hold on -- smiles and cries.  I                  hear you.                                JAKE                  You gotta control your smiles and                  cries.  No one can take them away                  so... they're all we really have.        Roger and Alonzo trade looks -- sharp kid.  Alonzo pats        Jake's shoulder.  To Roger:                                ALONZO                  Think this greenhorn can handle                  undercover?        Roger scrutinizes Jake a beat.  Smiles and nods:  yes.                                ROGER                  You were just like him.                                ALONZO                         (laughs)                  Fuck you.                                ROGER                  Same silly-ass look and                  everything.  Saving the fuckin'                  world.                                ALONZO                  That lasted a week.        Alonzo stands, shakes with Roger.                                ALONZO                  Brother, I gotta get back in my                  office.  Thanks for the snort,                  dog.  What're you up to today?        Roger gestures at the phones and beepers.                                ROGER                  Think I get out of the house?        A BEEPER BEEPS.  Roger shakes with Jake.                                ROGER                  Take care, Hoyt.  You're gonna do                  okay.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        South on Rampart.  Jake senses he passed a test.  Alonzo        smiling at him.                                JAKE                  What?                                ALONZO                  He liked you.                                JAKE                  Who is he?

C'mon, let's find some                  action in Niggertown.                         (off Jake's look)                  N-wordtown.  What are you, Hoyt?                  You ain't pure whiteboy.

You're all fucked up.                  How's the Espanol?                                JAKE                  Mas o menos.                                ALONZO                  Work on it.

Jake too.        Alonzo cracks two fresh beers -- Jake takes one, drops        it, soaking his leg.                                ALONZO                  Dumbass.  Don't spill it.

ALONZO                  You gotta be able to handle a                  high.  It's a necessary job skill.                  I'm not kidding.  It's an alcohol                  world down here.  You gotta be                  able to hang.  To get fucked up                  and talk shit with sketchy                  sociopathic dumbasses and not pass                  out and get your shoes stolen.                                JAKE                  I'm fine.  Just a little dizzy.        But Jake looks decidedly green.  He sips beer.  HICCUPS        mightily.  Alonzo brakes, flings open Jake's door.                                ALONZO                  Not in my car!        Jake leans out, vomits onto the street.  He hangs there a        beat, dry heaving.                                ALONZO                  Okay, okay.  Well's dry, kid.        He yanks Jake in by the collar.  Keeps driving.                                JAKE                  Sorry.                                ALONZO                  Wipe your chin.        Jake does, rinses his mouth with beer, spits out the        window.                                JAKE                  I'm cool now.  Had to unload the                  groceries.        He leans his head on the window pillar.        Jakes's eye absorb the street's tableau of unworldly        gliding by.  Palm trees and sunshine.  Paradise and hell        in one.        His lids begin to drift shut.        Then Jake sees a flash of movement in an alley.  Suddenly        alert, he paws at the doorhandle.                                JAKE                  Activity on the right?  Stop the                  car!                                ALONZO                  Siddown, Hoyt.  Everything's fine.

The        transmission GRINDS, tires SCREECH.  The engine stalls.        Jake is out like a shot --        EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        -- He dodges an oncoming car.                                ALONZO                  Get the fuck back here!        Jake into the alley.        ON G-RIDE        Alonzo pulling to the curb.                                ALONZO                  Dumb-ass kid.        ON JAKE        Running like a deer.  He enters the alley.

The Crackhead punches Jake's throat.  Stops him cold.        Jake realizes how huge this guy is.  Gulp.                                CRACKHEAD                  Gonna fuck you too, cop.        ANOTHER CRACKHEAD dives from the shadows and tackles        Jake.  Both go down hard.        Crackhead #1 stomps Jake's head.  Jake gets his arm        around Crackhead #2's neck, squeezes -- the forbidden        choke hold.        Alonzo enters the alley.  And just stands there,        watching.        Jake rides out Crackhead #I's vicious kicks as Crackhead        #2 convulses from hypoxia.  And finally goes limp.        Jake lets go, sweeps Crackhead #I's legs out from under        him and hops to his feet.  Crackhead #1 stands too.        The Schoolgirl looks on, stunned.                                CRACKHEAD #1                  You're ass is doomed.        Jake growls, snatches him up like a rag doll, spins him,        slams him hard.  In a flash, Jake twists him into a        pretzel, drops a knee on his neck, grinds his head into        the asphalt.  Clicks on the cuffs.                                CRACKHEAD #1                  We didn't do shit.  Bitch is crazy                  and shit.        Crackhead #2 coming to, starting to stand.  Jake crosses        to him, pins his head with his knee.  Slips a pair of        flexicuffs from his sock, zips them on the man's wrists.                                CRACKHEAD #2                  Man, you fuckin' up, slick.                  Homegirl tradin' her ass for                  cookies.

JAKE                  I have a punching bag at home.  I                  want them off the street.        Alonzo squats by Crackhead #1.  Searches him.                                ALONZO                  Hear that, bro?  My dog, here,                  wants to lock you up.  Been to the                  bootyhouse?  Grabbin' ankles for                  the big boys?                                CRACKHEAD #1                  Suck my dick, bitch.  I know                  people.                                ALONZO                  Kick back, who's-who.        Alonzo finds rocks in one sock.  Some twenties in the        other.  He pockets the cash and crack.  Searches        Crackhead #2.                                ALONZO                  Where's your horn?                                CRACKHEAD #2                  Ain't got no horn.

Alonzo hauls Crackhead #1 to his feet.  Unlocks the        cuffs, tosses them to Jake.  Crackhead #2 strains against        the flexicuffs.                                ALONZO                         (to Crackhead #2)                  You get to keep those.        He steers Crackhead #1 to a wall -- cocks his fist.                                ALONZO                  Ain't the first honey ya'll pinned                  to a wall, huh?  Close your eyes.        Crackhead does.  Alonzo knees his groin -- oof! -- He        falls to the ground, whimpers in the fetal position.                                ALONZO                  Next time I cut your dick off and                  shove it up your ass.                         (pats Jake's back, winks)                  I'll leave you three alone.  Gonna                  grab some beer.        Alonzo exits the alley.  Jake watches Crackhead #1        whimper, Crackhead #2 writhe in the gutter.  It's futi1e        to beat these men.  Jake takes pity, walks away.                                CRACKHEAD #2                  Pussy motherfucker.  Gonna see                  your ass again.  Gonna fuck you                  up, bitch.

Now you in my                  world, motherfucker.        Jake stops and turns around.  He stoops to pick up a pink        Hello Kitty change purse.

But it don't                  work like that.  They wipe out the                  good folks.  Notice how it's                  always school kids, mommies and                  ass-bustin' family men catching                  stray slugs in their noodles.  You                  protect the sheep by catching the                  wolves.  It takes a wolf to catch                  a wolf.                                JAKE                  What?                                ALONZO                  You protect --                                JAKE                  I heard you.  Whatever.        A beat.                                JAKE                  When do you lock anyone up?  Seems                  like you're too busy keeping people                  out.        Bad mistake.  Alonzo slaps him.  Glares at him.                                ALONZO                  Shut up, boot!  Nothin' but shit                  'tween your ears.

How many                  felons have you collared?                  Dickhead.        Now that it's clear who's the boss, they drive in tense        silence for a long beat.  Alonzo digs in his pocket --                                ALONZO                  Here...        -- hands Jake the rocks he found.  A beat.                                JAKE                  I'm not smoking crack.                                ALONZO                  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.                  Toss 'em in the glove box.        Jake does, sees several more rocks under some papers.                                ALONZO                  Comes in handy.  Like a debit                  card.                         (offers Jake a beer)                  You earned it.  C'mon.        Jake refuses.                                ALONZO                  No matter what I say, I want you                  to know, you did the right thing.                  Reminds me of when I could chase                  down anyone and fuck them up.                  You're a good cop.  You got fire.                  That was some amazing shit back                  there.                                JAKE                  Thanks.                                ALONZO                  That the choke hold I saw you                  applying?  Isn't that a big no-no,                  procedure-boy?                                JAKE                  Well...

Alonzo gives Jake a beer and grins at him like a proud        dad.                                ALONZO                  You got a magic eye, Hoyt.  You                  have a magic fucking eye.

CUT TO:        EXT. NORMANDIE AND VERNON - DAY        The G-Ride rolls through the intersection.  If you don't        know the neighborhood, stay the hell out.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        The area fills Alonzo's eyes with memories.                                ALONZO                  This is Southwest Div.  Did my                  probation here.  Learned a lot                  here.  Good things.  Bad things.                  Kicked some ass.  Had my ass                  kicked.                                JAKE                  Back in the days.                                ALONZO                  Yeah, back in the days.  Today's                  my date of employment.

Seven more and I                  cash outta the game.                                JAKE                  No shit.  Happy anniversary.        Jake holds out his hand.  Alonzo shakes it.  Kills his        beer, cracks another.                                ALONZO                  Thanks.  Thirteen's an unlucky                  number but the seven to go cancel                  it out.        Alonzo turns on Adams.  He reaches over, digs in the        glove box.  Pulls out a photograph and hands it to Jake.        INSERT - PHOTO        A spit-and-polish, young cop in crisp blues, white        gloves, holding his Beretta at inspection arms.        BACK TO SCENE        Jake looks at the photo, then at Alonzo.  Realizing:                                JAKE                  You're Mr. Clean.                                ALONZO                  I had a few misconceptions when I                  started out.                         (points out a house)                  On the left.  See that house?                  Dude named Spooky lived there.                  Mean old vato loco.  Mexican                  Mafia.  No one fucked with Spooky.                  Even got respect from the cops.                  We'd keep an eye on his house.                  You like dogs?                                JAKE                  Gotta six-year-old Rottweiler.                  Not too bright, but I can trust                  him with my kid.                                ALONZO                  Rotties are good dogs.  Dobermans                  are better.  Spooky raised                  Dobermans.  On my second week of                  patrol, when I was not knowin'                  shit, we roll by Spooky's one                  night.  I observe this old, black                  fool, named Too Fine, all drunk,                  beating the shit out of this                  female Doberman.  Beautiful dog,                  seven months old.  Too Fine's                  whoopin' her with a garden hose.                  This dog's just crying, shaking.                  I grew up with Dobermans.  I was                  pissed.  I tell my T.O. 'I'm gonna                  take him.'  And my T.O. is like:                  'No, no.  It's cool.'  He fuckin'                  waves to Too Fine and this                  motherfucker smiles and waves back                  and keeps hitting the dog.                  Thought I lost my damn mind.                  Tells me Spooky gave him twenty                  bucks to beat the shit out of it.                  My T.O., this good 'ol boy, looks                  me in the eye and says:  'Teaches                  'em to hate niggers.'  Almost quit                  right there.  Almost got out of                  the fuckin' black and white and                  took the bus home.        Jake looks at Alonzo.                                JAKE                  That's fucked up.  That's one of                  the most fucked up things I ever                  heard.                                ALONZO                  Just remembered that.  Every time                  I'd seen it all, the street'd show                  me something even more fucked up.                  I know you didn't see no shit like                  that in the Valley.                                JAKE                  No, I haven't.        Jake takes a last look at the photograph of young Alonzo        and replaces it in the glove box.        Alonzo enters an alley cutting through several blocks.                                ALONZO                  Double-nickel Crips control shit                  here.  They come up hard.

Feed your dead ass to a pit bull.                  Youngins here fight for the right                  to dump a cop.  Everyone wants a                  name.                                JAKE                  That really happen?                                ALONZO                  No, Hoyt, I'm pullin' your dick.                  Anything can happen.  It's loony                  tunes here.  Keep an eye out for                  rock stars.        Alonzo pulls on a side street where PEANUT, a young        gangster, is ready to serve them.                                ALONZO                  There's one.  Don't let him see                  your face.  And don't let anyone                  run up on us with a shotgun.        Alonzo pulls out a twenty, stops near Peanut, who crosses        to his window.                                PEANUT                  What you want, homie?                                ALONZO                         (flashes twenty)                  Twenty.  Gimme a big-ass chip.        Peanut takes a rock from his pocket, gives it to Alonzo,        reaches for the twenty -- CLICK-CLICK!  Alonzo cuffs him        to the steering wheel --                                ALONZO                  Let's take a ride, asshole.        -- Stomps the gas, SCREECH!  Peanut runs to keep up.        Alonzo stops at the end of the alley.                                ALONZO                  You from double nickel?                                PEANUT                  Ain't from shit.                                ALONZO                  Again:  Where you from?                                PEANUT                  My mom.                                ALONZO                  Your mom?  From her ass?  You a                  butt baby?                                PEANUT                  Fuck you --        -- SCREECH!  Alonzo races in reverse down the alley.        Peanut is yanked off his feet.  His legs drag in the        dirt.  Alonzo stops, lights a squished Marlboro.  He has        Peanut's attention.                                ALONZO                  What do they call you?                                PEANUT                  Peanut.                                ALONZO                  You in double nickel, Peanut?        Peanut nods.                                ALONZO                  See, respect me, I respect you.                  Talk shit, I fuck you up.  Ah'ite,                  homie.                                PEANUT                  Ah'ite.                                ALONZO                  Who's the boss?                                PEANUT                  You.                                ALONZO                  No, dumbass.  Who you slangin'                  for?        Peanut clams up.  Alonzo grabs the gearshift.                                ALONZO                  Gimme a name or your hand.  Choose                  now.        Peanut stares at his hand, flexes it.  Alonzo revs the        engine.                                PEANUT                  Mr. Mighty.        Alonzo shoves forty bucks in Peanut's hand, unlocks        him --                                ALONZO                  Back to work, poo-butt.        -- and drives away.  Peanut flips him off.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        Jake adds Peanut's rock to the glovebox.

Alonzo fishes out an assault vest, tosses it to Jake and        dons an LAPD windbreaker, POLICE across the back.                                ALONZO                  Intel says his mom's in the                  residence with two female                  juveniles and a possible male                  juvenile.                                JAKE                  If he's not here, why are we here?        Alonzo pulls a paper out of his pocket, unfolds it.                                ALONZO                  We gotta serve this search                  warrant.        It's the Chinese take-out menu Jake handed him earlier.                                JAKE                  We can't do that.                                ALONZO                  Yes we can, supercop.  Ding-ding,                  that's the schoolbell.        He slams the trunk.

ALONZO                  Don't get me killed, new guy.        He knocks on the security screen.                                ALONZO                  Police!  Search warrant!        Silence.

The Woman on the        couch, pissed.                                JAKE                  Stand up, ma'am.        He searches the couch for a weapon.                                ALONZO                  Anyone else in the house, ma'am?                                WOMAN                  My nephew, Dimitri.  He in the                  bedroom.

Go sit on the couch with your                  aunt -- House is code-four.  Gonna                  start my search.        Alonzo exits.  The Woman glares at Jake.                                WOMAN                  I wanna read the warrant.                                JAKE                         (reacts)                  My partner has it.

JAKE                  Hey, little man.  How's it going?        Jake tries to shake.  Dimitri crosses his arms, looks        away.  The Woman smirks.        O.S., the SOUNDS of Alonzo tearing apart the bedrooms        like a hurricane.  Making a hell of a mess.        The Woman stands.                                JAKE                  Ma'am.

Gotta get liquored up to do                  business?        Alonzo is suddenly quiet.  Jake backs to the doorway,        peeks around it.  Sees a dresser with a mirror.        IN MIRROR        Alonzo shoves something big down his raidjacket.        BACK TO SCENE                                JAKE                  Siddown.

Alonzo enters, excited, grinning.                                ALONZO                  Didn't find shit.  Let's go --                  Sorry about the inconvenience,                  ma'am.  Thank you for your                  cooperation.        He and Jake head for the door.                                WOMAN                  I wanna see the warrant.                                ALONZO                  Here.        He hands her the menu as they exit.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY        At the end of the block, three big GANGSTERS buy        popsicles from a Mexican vendor.        ANOTHER ANGLE        The Woman bursts out of the house, screams at Jake and        Alonzo as they climb in the G-Ride.                                WOMAN                  Fuckin' jackers!

WOMAN                  Why ya'll standin' there lookin'                  pretty?!  Blast them fools!        The gangsters trade looks.  Start running towards --        G-RIDE        Alonzo sees the gangsters.  Tries STARTING the CAR.  The        engine won't catch.                                ALONZO                  C'mon, baby.  Don't do me like                  that.        The gangsters getting closer.                                ALONZO                  Fuckin' bitch!  Start!        Nothing.  Alonzo piles out.  Raises the hood, taps the        carb with the butt of his gun.                                ALONZO                  Start it!        Jake twists the screwdriver.  No dice.  He sees a Glock        pulled from a waistband.  Alonzo tapping.                                JAKE                  Gun!  Gun!  Gun!                                ALONZO                  Start it!        VAROOM!  Alonzo slams the hood.  Climbs in.  SQUEALS from        the driveway.        The armed gangster drops to one knee.        The G-Ride tear-asses away in Glock's sights.        POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!        A ROUND SHATTERS a taillight.        ANOTHER pierces the trunk --        INT. G-RIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        -- the back seat -- the front seat -- the six pack -- and        finally the dash.        Jake reacting to beer spray.  Alonzo rounds the corner,        tosses the wounded cans out the window.                                ALONZO                  Shit... Let's hit a liquor store.        Jake fingers the hole in the dash.                                ALONZO                  Gun!  Gun!  Gun!        Jake startles, Alonzo laughing.                                ALONZO                  First time you been shot at?                                JAKE                         (lies)                  No.                                ALONZO                  Yeah, it is.                                JAKE                  That wasn't cool.  That wasn't                  cool at all.  What the fuck were                  you doing in there?                                ALONZO                  Looking for narcotics activity.                  Scales.  Baggies.  Guns.  Coke.                  Bud.  Etcetera.

JAKE                  She was screaming about money.                                ALONZO                  Bitch was talking shit.  Trying to                  get us blasted by her homies.        Jake's eyes fall to a brick-shaped bulge under Alonzo's        raid jacket.                                ALONZO                  What?                                JAKE                  I dunno.  I'm just a new guy.  A                  daisy-fresh scuzz-head boot.  You                  tell me what.                                ALONZO                  I don't deny my shit stinks.  I                  will never deny that.  So why do I                  got the best arrest and conviction                  record in the county.  Why?                  'Cause I don't handicap myself                  with bullshit.                                JAKE                  I thought that bullshit served a                  purpose.                                ALONZO                  You thought wrong.  There's                  hemorrhoids walking free on the                  streets right now who've killed                  fuckin' three, four, five people.                  I know it, they know it, every                  detective on payroll knows it.                  Why do these turds still float                  around?  The rules.  I take down                  the duly deserving.  I'm not                  locking up Mr. Nine-to-five, Mr.                  Family Provider.        Jake shaking his head angrily.                                ALONZO                  C'mon, communicate.  What aren't                  you saying?  Talk to me.        A beat.  Then Jake fixes Alonzo with a stare.                                JAKE                  I think... I think you're a rogue                  cop.        Alonzo laughs his ass off.  Wipes his eyes, he laughs so        hard.                                ALONZO                  Fuckin' Hoyt, man.  Know what?                  You're alright.  You are alright.        Jake gives him an ""I'm not stupid"" look.                                ALONZO                  You're in a privileged position to                  learn a thing or two if you can                  keep your mouth shut and your eyes                  open.  If you're serious about                  doing good out in the real world,                  this is the place to learn how.                  If this shit shakes you up, go                  back to Division and cry to the                  Watch Commander.  He'll find you a                  nice job lighting flares and                  measuring wrecks.  Decide now if                  you want to be a wolf or a sheep.                  If you want on my squad, I'll sign                  your card.        Alonzo stops the car.  Reaches over and opens Jake's        door.                                ALONZO                  If not, get out of my car.        Jake looks at Alonzo, he turns away and reacts.        JAKE'S POV        They are parked in front of a police station, steps lead        up to a pair of glass doors.        BACK TO SCENE        Jake sits there a beat.  He gives Alonzo a final look.        Then gets out of the car.        EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        Jake stiffly marches up the steps.  Then stops.  And        turns.  Alonzo staring at him.  Waiting for him to change        his mind.        A beat.  Jake shakes his head:  no.        SCREECH!  Alonzo is gone.

Overweight cops talk on the        phones.  Pension jockeys tap away at keyboards.  This is        about as far from the action as you can get.        BACK TO SCENE        Jake looks at a sign over a door:  ""WATCH COMMANDER"".        Instead of crossing to it.  Jake looks at his hands,        dirty and scraped from fighting.  Jake turns around and        exits.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY        As Jake descends the steps, the G-Ride pulls up.

JAKE                  I'm going to do my best.                                ALONZO                  You do and you'll run the unit                  someday.

CENTRAL AVENUE - DAY        The G-Ride pulls onto a side street then winds its way        through a maze of shabby streets.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. G-RIDE - MOVING - DAY        Jake nervously glances around one of the toughest parts        of the city.  A strong point adorned with wrought iron        and concertina wire.                                JAKE                  What are you doing?  We'll be                  killed coming in here.                                ALONZO                  Oh, you've heard about this neck                  of the woods?                                JAKE                  No man's land.                         (points)                  You got Broadway there, dividing                  the eastside-westside Hispanic                  gangs.  And Adams Boulevard there                  is the only thing separating the                  Rolling Twenties Bloods from the                  Hoover Crips.  They said never                  come in here with anything less                  than a platoon.                                ALONZO                         (impressed)                  On top of that, area's an                  administrative nightmare.  Four                  L.A.P.D. Division boundaries meet                  here.  Rampart, Central, Southwest                  and Newton.  That makes everything                  that happens here the other guy's                  problem.        Jake is really uncomfortable.                                JAKE                  I thought we were going to eat.        Alonzo gives him a reassuring look and stops in front of        a cul-de-sac of run down houses and apartments.  He        HONKS.        A little kid runs out of the corner house.  He eyes        Alonzo then hops on his bike and rides OUT OF VIEW into        the cul-de-sac.  A beat.        The little kid returns.  Waves Alonzo into the cul-de-        sac.  Alonzo turns onto the dangerous dead-end, driving        around a poorly parked van.                                JAKE                  That little kid's a lookout.                                ALONZO                  Lots of eyes on us right now.                  Never come up in here without me.                  For your safety.  I'm serious.                                JAKE                  Okay.  Why do you have a golden                  pass?                                ALONZO                  Because I'm square with 'em.  But                  they know if the line is crossed,                  I'm leading the platoon in here.        Alonzo parks in front of some apartments.  Jake and        Alonzo get out.        An old woman sweeps her doorstep and glares at Jake.                                ALONZO                  Buenas tardes, Dona Lucila.        The old woman smiles, nods.        Jake and Alonzo pass a long driveway as they cross to        some stairs.        JAKE'S POV        At the far end of the driveway, gangsters work out and        drink.  One of them is benching over 300 pounds.        BACK TO SCENE                                ALONZO                  Don't look at them.        Alonzo and Jake climb the steps.                                ALONZO                  See that dude benching?                                JAKE                  Yeah, Jesus.                                ALONZO                  Exactly, you run into him; you                  pray.  Real quick hands for a big                  guy.  Used to make money boxing                  but he fucked that up.        Alonzo knocks on a door.                                JAKE                  What's here?                                ALONZO                  A loving touch.                                WOMAN (O.S.)                  Quien...?                                ALONZO                  Policia, senorita.        The door opens, there stands SARA, a ravishing Salvadoran        in a housedress.  She hugs Alonzo, plants a big kiss on        him --                                SARA                  Hi, papi.        -- then notices Jake and backs off.                                ALONZO                  He's just my new guy.        She holds out her hand.  They shake.                                SARA                  Hi.  How are you?

Alonzo enters, Jake follows.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. APARTMENT - DAY        The living room is filled with Salvadoran kitsch.  A 2-        year-old boy on the couch watches cartoons.  Alonzo        motions for Jake to sit.                                ALONZO                  You had a rough morning.  Relax                  and let her hook you up.        He disappears into the bedroom.  Sara hands Jake the        remote.                                SARA                  Here.  Take this.  I have cable.                  You watch what you want.  This is                  your house.  Don't be shy.        She crosses to the kitchen.  Sounds of POTS, DISHES.        Jake is about to change the channel.  The kid gives him a        look.  He puts away the remote.        Sara returns with a massive tray of food, chicken stew,        beans, rice, salad, tortillas, the works.  She sets the        mouth-watering spread before Jake.                                SARA                  This is El Salvador food.  I hope                  you like it.                                JAKE                  Thank you.  This is great.  I'm                  starving.        She hangs a beat, eabarrassed.                                SARA                  I'm sorry.  I have too...        Jake knows.  She runs off.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. BEDROOM - DAY        Sara hands Alonzo a beer.  Alonzo lays back on the bed        with a huge grin.  She surveys him, smiles.                                SARA                  Wow.  That's something different.                  You're smiling.

Doug and Stan see Alonzo, react like they've seen a        ghost.  So Lou turns around, sees Alonzo.  And quickly        stands.        It's tense.  Like there could be a gunfight.  Jake's hand        creeps near his gun.        Alonzo and Lou converge, trading serious questions and        answers with their eyes.        Jake watches Stan and Doug.  They watch him.

ALONZO                  Thanks, Lou.  What, marked your                  calendar?        Lou smiles, taps his temple.  Doug and Stan shake with        Alonzo.  It's clear he makes them uncomfortable.                                DOUG                  Congratulations.  Good to see you.                                STAN                  Congratulations.

Alonzo grabs Jake's shoulder, pulls him into the huddle.                                ALONZO                  This is Jake Hoyt, first day on                  the squad.        Jake shakes Lou's hand.  Sees an LAPD Captain's badge on        his belt.  Jake realizes these guys are police        administrators.                                ALONZO                  Jake, this is Lou Jacobs,                  interagency task-force                  coordinator.

LOU                  Have a seat, guy.        Alonzo slides into the booth after Lou.                                ALONZO                         (to Jake)                  Shoo, boy.  Shoo.        He points out the adjacent booth.  Jake crosses, sits,        his back to their table.                                LOU                  Seems like a good kid.        An attractive tall blonde waitress, JULIE, brings a fresh        pitcher of beer.                                ALONZO                  Fuckin' elbow benders read my                  mind.                                LOU                  Look's like you're way ahead of us.                                ALONZO                  I'm always a step ahead of you                  guys.        Julie smiles at Alonzo.                                JULIE                  There's the mystery man.  Thought                  you gave up on us.  What've you                  been up to?                                ALONZO                  Been good.                                JULIE                  More bad than good, right?                                ALONZO                  You know it.                                JULIE                  Mmmm-hmmm.  You need to eat.                  Combo plate?                                ALONZO                  No.  I'm good.  Toss the kid,                  there, a taco and a beer.        Alonzo grabs the pitcher, starts pouring.  Julie walks        away.                                ALONZO                  Why the long face, Doug?  Feds                  seize your house or something?        Chuckles from Lou and Stan.                                DOUG                  Fuck you, Alonzo.                                STAN                  Doug had a bad day in court                  today -- Tell him what happened.                                DOUG                  You tell him, think it's so funny.                                STAN                  He went to a sentencing hearing.                  On a three strikes case against a                  silk-suit catburglar type.                  Fuckwad pulled fifteen Encino                  burglaries.                                DOUG                  Spent twelve months trying to                  catch the suspect, a real                  slickster, gave up nothing.                  Captain rode my ass the entire                  time.  What broke it?  Luck.                  Caught in the act by a fuckin'                  patrolman.  We had him.                  It was the prosecutor's first                  serial burglary case but he slam-                  dunked it from a stepladder.                  Clockwork trial.  Jury deliberates                  half a day.  Comes back guilty on                  ten out of eleven counts.  The                  fuckbag was looking at a twenty-                  five mininum.                                STAN                  Mininum.  Bye-bye, toilet-licker.                                DOUG                  Sentencing was today --                                LOU                  -- Judge is female.                                DOUG                  Right.  Female judge.                                ALONZO                  Who?                                DOUG                  Landers.  The stress-case                  brunette.                                ALONZO                  I know her.  Sharp lady.                                DOUG                  Before this guy goes to the                  hearing, he gets a hold of some                  peanut butter and packs his ass                  crack with it.  So there he is,                  standing tall before the bench to                  give his statement and he shoves                  his hand down his pants and comes                  out with a gob of fuckin' extra-                  chunky Jiff.  Could'a heard a pin                  drop.  Bailiffs wouldn't come near                  him.  He looks the judge right in                  her eyes and licks his fingers                  clean.  Holy shit.  The judge, she                  screams.  All these homeowners are                  there to read statements, they run                  out of screaming.        Alonzo is breaking up.  Stan and Lou, too.        ON JAKE        laughing too.  Julie returns with a beer and a taco        plate.  And walks away with a flirty smile.        BACK TO STAN                                STAN                  No, wait, here's the punchline...                                DOUG                  Judge Landers, she says:                         (falsetto)                  Oh, this poor man's insane, he                  can't go to prison.                         (himself, grim)                  She ordered him to psychiatric.                                ALONZO                         (floored)                  You are fucking kidding.  She fell                  for it?                                DOUG                  Time she found out it was sandwich                  spread, the order was signed and                  he'd been transferred.                                ALONZO                  Proceedings closed.                                DOUG                  Proceedings closed.                                STAN                  Fucker'll do six months in the                  puzzle factory before they say                  he's normal and kick him loose.                                DOUG                  So a maggot gnaws on a                  wrinkleneck.  Real or not, lock                  him up.  He's repulsive not                  insane.                                LOU                  Little kids eat their own shit.                                STAN                  Not my kids, Lou.                                ALONZO                  It's called coprolagnia.  People                  do it for sex kicks.                                STAN                  Bullshit.  How do you know?                                ALONZO                  Had a case when I worked vice.                                LOU                  Only in America.                                ALONZO                  If the asshole's clever enough to                  play the system like that, I say                  he earned his freedom.                                DOUG                  I see him on the street, I'm gonna                  fuckin' do him.                                ALONZO                  Take his bullets, Stan.        Laughs.  Alonzo pours a fresh round.                                ALONZO                  Hey, listen to this, my new guy,                  right?  Been showing him around                  town.  Scored some reefer for him                  to smoke.  But he wouldn't.  So I                  run through the whole bit, the gun                  to the head.  Everything.  'Okay,'                  he says.  I light up and it stinks                  like burnt rubber, right?  I pass                  it to him anyway.        The detectives grin knowingly.                                STAN                  You're an asshole.                                DOUG                  Kid's gotta learn.                                ALONZO                  He sucks the shit down.  Showing                  me he can hang.  We're in                  MacArthur Park and he starts                  screaming and jumps out of the                  fuckin' car.  And runs down the                  street.  Omigod.  I thought he                  lost it.        The detectives are hooked.  So is...        JAKE        Listening, sipping beer.                                ALONZO                  So I chase him down this alley                  and, holy shit, he's jamming two                  huge crackheads and there's this                  pretty girl with a bloody nose.                  Kid stopped a rape.                                STAN                  No shit.                                ALONZO                  No shit.

Jake beams with beer-buzzed pride.        ON DETECTIVES                                ALONZO                  His first day on the squad and                  know what he tells me?                         (pathetic voice)                  'You're a rogue cop.'        Roars of laughter from the Detectives.  Lou refills        beers, holds up his glass for a toast.                                LOU                  Okay.  Okay, ladies...

ROGER                  What's going down, Alonzo?                                ALONZO                  I had lunch with the three wise                  men.  You gotta render unto                  Caesar.        Roger sees the tools and knows exactly what they are for.                                ROGER                  Those goddamn vampires want my                  pension.                                ALONZO                  No, man, it's not like that.                  You're just getting taxed.  They                  got their boat payments and God                  knows what.  I'm sorry.  They're                  makin' me do it.  I'm just a lowly                  civil servant.                                ROGER                  Fuck you.  You're their bitch.                  What happens with me?                                ALONZO                  Don't worry, bro.  I promised                  you'd never go back to prison.  I                  got your back.  You won't even                  miss what I'm gonna take.  I hate                  doing this.  Orders is orders.                  Sorry, dog.                                ROGER                  No, you ain't.  Cop.                                ALONZO                         (to Tim and Jeff)                  You guys are gonna work.  Get the                  tools.                         (grabs Jake's shotgun)                  Gimme the boomer.        Tim and Jeff gather the tools.  Alonzo hands Jake a pick        and leads the three men to a bedroom door.  Roger pours a        slug of Crown Royal as Paul and Mark guard him.                                ROGER                  Who's paying for my floor?                                ALONZO                  The city.        INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        Alonzo flips the bed.  Taps the floor with his toe.                                ALONZO                  Open the floor.  Right here.        Jake, Tim and Jeff begin chopping.  It's quick work to        tear a large hole in the wood.                                ALONZO                  Hop in, Hoyt.  Couple'a of feet                  down, there's a locker.        Jake jumps in.  Attacking dirt with his pick.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. BEDROOM - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER)        Jake, Tim and Jeff haul a trash-bag-wrapped footlocker        out of the hole.                                JAKE                  What's in it?                                ALONZO                  Open it.        Jake tears away trash bags.  Alonzo takes a pick and        snaps the lock.  Jake opens the lid -- taped bundles        inside.                                JAKE                  It's coke?                                ALONZO                  Go ahead.  It won't bite.        Jake grabs a bundle.  Hefts it in his hand.                                JAKE                  Hmmm.  A good five kilos.        Alonzo hands him a penknife.  Jake pokes a hole --        nothing pours out.                                ALONZO                  Cut the damn thing open.        Jake does -- it is a brick of fifty dollar bills.  Alonzo        is relieved to see the money.  Jake likes its heft.                                JAKE                  This is sweet.                                ALONZO                  That's a hundred grand in your hot                  little hands.  There's four                  million bucks in there.        Alonzo slaps Jack's back.                                ALONZO                  First day on the job and you're in                  on a three million dollar seizure.                                JAKE                  You said four.                                ALONZO                  Told you, nothing's for free.                  Gotta grease the rails to make the                  big moves.        Alonzo grabs a pillowcase.  Tosses bricks of fifties in        it.  Hands it to Jake.                                ALONZO                  Here.  Lucky to get this, day-one-                  motherfucker.                                JAKE                  What's this?                                ALONZO                  Sweet green clean legal tender.                  Start the kid's college fund                  early.  Get the old lady a                  minivan.        However pleasant the heft, Jake could never accept.  He        returns the pillowcase to Alonzo.                                JAKE                  No way.  Only checks I cash say                  City of L.A. on 'em.                                JEFF                  Someone didn't sleep through Ethics.                                ALONZO                  You said you wanted a piece.                                JAKE                  Not like this.                                ALONZO                  I understand.  I'II hold on to it                  for you.  Not everyone's                  comfortable the first time --                  Let's wrap up.        Alonzo drops the pillowcase in the locker.  Exits.  Jake,        Tim and Jeff follow.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY        Roger reads a Vegas odds paper.  Alonzo, Tim, Jeff and        Jake enter.  Roger glares at Alonzo.                                ROGER                  What have I done to those guys?                  Are they nuts?  Am I supposed to                  stand still and let them horsefuck                  me?                                ALONZO                  No.  We can put you out of your                  misery.        Alonzo tosses Jake the shotgun.                                ALONZO                  Lemme tell you a secret, Hoyt.  If                  you kill someone on duty, they                  have to be your slave in the                  afterlife.                         (points to Roger)                  There you go.  Start an entourage.                                JAKE                  You want me to shoot him?        Paul, Mark, Tim and Jeff snicker, crack smiles.  Roger        too.  Jake plays along, points the shotgun at Roger.                                ROGER                  You'd be doin' me a favor, kid.                                JAKE                  Bang -- There.        He lowers the weapon.                                ALONZO                  Not gonna to do it?                                JAKE                  Of course not.  This isn't funny.        Alonzo smiles.  Takes the shotgun from him.                                ALONZO                  Man, youngsters these days.  Can't                  get shit done unless you do it                  yourself.        Alonzo aims at Roger...        BOOM!  Roger is punched ragged with BUCKSHOT, lifted off        his couch, knocked into the wall.        Jake jumps back.        A peal of laughter from Tim.  Contagious giggles from the        others.  Roger gurgles.  Jake stares wide-eyed at Alonzo.                                JAKE                  Holy shit!        Jake's shock elicits more giggles from the squad.                                PAUL                  Finish him.        Jake watches Alonzo cross to Roger, blindly gasping.                                ALONZO                  He's finished.        Alonzo takes one of Roger's derringers from the floor.        Slaps it in the dying man's hand.                                ALONZO                  C'mere, Jeff.  You took fire                  coming through the door.        Jeff smiles, gets in position so Alonzo can shoot him.                                JEFF                  Alright.  Gonna get some time off.        He braces himself.  Alonzo aims Roger's hand.  Pop!  A        BULLET THWACKS harmlessly into Jeff's vest.  He removes        his sunglasses from a pocket.                                JEFF                  Watch my Oakleys.        Jake looking at Roger, it's hard watching him die.        Again Jeff braces.  Pop!  The THWACK of another BULLET.                                ALONZO                  How's that?        Jeff probing his hand under the vest.                                JEFF                  Fine.        Alonzo drops the gun in an envelope marked:  EVIDENCE        HANDGUN.  Jake can't believe what he just saw.                                ALONZO                  Listen up.  This is the scenario.                  Mark and Paul kick the door.  Jeff                  is first through.  Roger opens                  fire.  Hits Jeff twice.        Jeff coughs -- bright foamy blood in his hand.                                JEFF                  Oh, shit.                                ALONZO                  One go through?        Jeff answers by coughing more blood.  Tim runs to him.                                TIM                  Siddown, dude.        Jeff does.  Tim opens the vest -- a hole in a seam on the        edge.  Underneath, bruised puckered flesh drools blood.                                TIM                  You shot him!                                JEFF                  You fuckin' shot me!                                TIM                  Call a rescue.                                ALONZO                  You're fine.  You'll get a medal.                                JEFF                  Call the R.A.!                                ALONZO                  Let me run the scenario and I                  will.  Okay -- Mark and Paul kick                  the door.  First through is Jeff.                  Bang.  Bang.  Gets hit.  Wounded.                  Second through is our new guy,                  Hoyt.  He drops the suspect with                  some fine shotgun work.                         (points at Mark)                  Who shot Roger?                                MARK                  The new guy.  Came in spraying.                                ALONZO                  Paul?                                PAUL                  The boot shot him.                                ALONZO                  What'd you guys see?                                TIM                  Hoyt blasted him.                                JEFF                  Hoyt went for it -- Now will you                  get me a fucking rescue ambulance?        Jake looks at these guys.  They look back, smiling,        smirking.  He feels dizzy, sick as the nightmare sinks        in.        Jeff coughs blood.  Alonzo tosses his rover to Paul.                                PAUL                         (into rover)                  Eleven forty-nine.  Nine-nine-                  eight.  Shots fired.  Shots fired.                  Man down.  Fifty-nine fifty-one                  Baxter Street.                                ALONZO                         (slaps Jake's back)                  Good job, son.  Congratulations.                  Gonna get a medal of valor.                                JAKE                  ... I didn't shoot him...                                ALONZO                  Roomful of cops says you did.                                JAKE                  Fuck you.  I don't care.  I didn't                  shoot him.  You did.        Alonzo pulls his gun.  Aims at Jake's face.                                ALONZO                         (as a newscaster)                  A Los Angeles Police Department                  narcotics officer was killed                  serving a high risk warrant in                  Echo Park today.  An L.A.P.D.                  spokesperson said the young                  officer was survived by his wife                  and infant child.                         (himself)                  Shit gets deeper.  Get the picture?                                JAKE                  I got the picture.        Jake strikes -- twists back Alonzo's gun sharply --        sweeps away his legs with a kick.        Alonzo finds himself on his back, Jake's knee on his        neck, staring down the maw of his own pistol.                                JAKE                  That's the second time you've                  stuck a gun in my face.  Won't be                  a third.        Paul presses his Beretta against Jake's temple.                                PAUL                  Be my pleasure putting a                  hydrashock in your melon.        Tim, Jeff, Mark gawk at the Mexican standoff.                                PAUL                  But I'm gonna be cool.  Open your                  hand slowly.  Drop the weapon.        Jake's free hand inches to his holstered gun --                                JAKE                         (super-calm)                  Hey, sorry, man.  Relax, okay7        -- and snatches it -- He swings on Tim -- who swings his        .45 on Jake.  A three-way standoff.                                JAKE                  Wanna shoot me, Paul?  Go ahead.                  Because these two are gonna be                  wiping my ass in the netherworld.        A beat.  Then:                                TIM                  Alonzo.  This is bad.                                PAUL                  This dude's a fuckin' fed.                                ALONZO                  He's no fed.  Just a choirboy with                  heart who got the drop on you                  fools.  Everyone, let's take a                  deep breath and defuse this --                  Jake?  You hear me?                                JAKE                  You can't just spring this shit on                  me.  I never signed up for this.                                ALONZO                  I hear you.  I know you're                  angry -- Paul, Tim, please put                  down your guns.                                TIM                  Hell no.                                PAUL                  Choirboy first.        SIRENS approach.  Lots of them.                                ALONZO                  Both of you:  guns down.  Now.        Paul and Tim reluctantly lower their weapons.  Jake lifts        his knee off Alonzo's neck, stands and backs away, aiming        both pistols at Alonzo, who climbs to his feet.                                ALONZO                  Jake, use your ears and listen.                  Sometimes we take shit all the                  way.  That's the nature of the                  game.  We don't do this every day.                  No one will ever again ask you to                  pull a trigger you don't want to                  -- Mark, where're you                  transferring to?                                MARK                  Westside Homicide.                                ALONZO                  Westside Homicide -- Only made                  detective last test.  Jake, give                  me eighteen months and I'll give                  you a career.  We make the big                  arrests.  We make the big                  seizures.  When someone's in my                  unit they're in all the way or not                  at all.  I thought you were man                  enough to handle this shit.        Alonzo calmly pours himself a whisky.                                ALONZO                  Five proven, decorated officers                  say you were the shooter.                  Investigators are gonna pull a                  tube of your blood and test for                  intoxicants.  Remember all the                  P.C.P. you smoked today?        Jake does, wincing at his stupidity.                                JAKE                  You've been planning this all day.                                ALONZO                  I've been planning this all week.                  You start talking crazy shit, I                  will make sure the right sample                  goes to the lab.                  Still wanna talk your babynuts                  around the block?  You won't make                  it to the corner.  But if you're                  cool.  You're a hero.  A virgin                  shooter above suspicion.        Jake looks at Roger, gasping like a beached carp.  The        SIRENS are getting closer.  Alonzo gulps his drink and --        Pfffffst!  Spits the booze in Jake's face.        Jake is blinded.  Paul seizes Jake's wrists and aims the        pistols at the ceiling.  Alonzo wrenches the pistols from        his hands.        Jake wipes his eyes, looks at the roomful of crazy cops,        scared.  Paul points at Roger's other derringer, laying        on the carpet.                                PAUL                  Alonzo, there's two shots in that                  stinger.  Let's kill your boy                  right now and say Roger dumped him                  coming through the door.        Mark, Tim, Jeff like the idea.  Jake doesn't.  And lucky        for him, neither does Alonzo.  He stands protectively in        front of Jake.                                ALONZO                  No.  We're not killing him.  He's                  a good guy.  Man's got the magic.                  Just having a little freakout is                  all.  We've all been there.  I say                  he's cool.  No one's gonna hurt                  him.        Jake and Alonzo trade a look.  The SIRENS are close.        Alonzo returns Jake his gun.                                ALONZO                  Hoyt, you gotta decision to make.                  In thirty seconds, this place will                  be overrun with patrolmen.  Go                  outside and clear your head.  Or                  shoot me now.        Jake is only too happy to get out of there.  Jake crosses        to exit, pauses, an afterthought?                                JAKE                  Hey, Paul.        Crack!  Jake nails his jaw.  Paul staggers, almost falls.        To Jake as he exits:                                PAUL                  You're dead!  I'm takin' you out.                  I don't care.                                ALONZO                  Kick back, Wyatt Earp.  Gotta                  respect a motherfucker who puts                  you on queer street with one                  punch.        Alonzo catches his men trading looks.                                ALONZO                  Kid's got more balls than all you                  faggots combined.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. ROGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LONG SHOT - ROGER'S HOUSE        - DAY        from a distant hilltop.  The ambulances and black and        whites out front shimmer in golden afternoon heat.  OVER:                                PARAMEDIC (V.O.)

Left lower quadrant posterior                  axillary line.        ZOOM IN --        Amidst the heat mirages, Alonzo talks to a uniformed        sergeant.  Two more paramedics wheel Jeff outside on a        stretcher.  Mark, Tim and Paul following.                                PARAMEDIC (V.O.)

Stand by for skin signs.                  Patient's skin is pale and cool                  and diaphoretic.  Here's the                  vitals:  B.P. sixty and                  palpitated.  Respiration thirty-                  one, decreased on the left with                  hyper-resonance.        Roger is lifted into an ambulance.  Alonzo dismisses        Jeff's paramedics and huddles with his men.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. ALLEY - DAY        Alonzo crosses to the G-ride with an armload of gear.        Pops the trunk. Dumps everything inside.  He shuts the        trunk.  Dials his cell phone and gets in the car.        ANGLE ON JAKE        leaning against a phone pole.  Watching as Alonzo pulls a        clipboard from under his seat and puts on reading        glasses.  Alonzo begins writing a major incident report        as he talks on his cell.  A beat.        Alonzo STARTS the G-RIDE.  Motions for Jake to get in.        INT. G-RIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY        Jake gets in.  Alonzo with his reading glasses, the        clipboard on his steering wheel, filling in the report,        talking on his cell phone, laughing.                                ALONZO                  -- you're gonna be scrubbing the                  bathtub, homie.  Later.        Alonzo hangs up.  Preoccupied with filling in little        boxes on the report as he drives slowly down the alley.                                ALONZO                  Why didn't you take off?                                JAKE                  There's nowhere to run.                                ALONZO                  Roger was D.O.A. at Good                  Samaritan.  Let's get the paper                  rolling now.        Alonzo looks at Jake, sees his torment.                                ALONZO                  Justifiable homicide in the line                  of duty.  Anyone'd be proud to                  have that in their jacket.                                JAKE                  Not this way.  Say I don't play                  along?                                ALONZO                  At this point it behooves you not                  to fuck around.        That's the truth.  And Jake knows it.  We can almost hear        his heart breaking.  Jake stares out the window a beat,        clenching his jaw, finally he looks at Alonzo, stares at        Alonzo's scary, empty eyes.  Amazed to be utterly trapped        by them.                                JAKE                  It can't be like this.        A beat.                                ALONZO                  It is like this.        Jake has a lump in his throat as they drive in silence        for a long beat.                                ALONZO                  Look, the money I gave you, keep                  it.                                JAKE                  Told you, I don't want it.                                ALONZO                  Just take it.  Throw it in the                  ocean.  Barbecue it.  Just take                  it.  It would make the boys feel                  better.                                JAKE                  Fuck their feelings.                                ALONZO                  Jake, they're worried.                                JAKE                  About what?                                ALONZO                  About you.  You didn't make anyone                  feel you were on the team back                  there.                                JAKE                  Fuck the team.  You guys are                  insane.  I'll go back to Valley                  and cut parking tickets.  And tell                  Paul:  he comes near me again,                  I'll shoot him.                                ALONZO                  I'm really sorry I exposed you to                  that today.  It was ugly but it                  was necessary.  Roger sold dope to                  kids.  World's a better place                  because he's gone.  Never seen no                  one die before?  You're too damn                  soft.  Bet you never missed a meal                  in your life.                                JAKE                         (glares at Alonzo)                  Missed a lot of meals growing up.                  Why?                         (pantomimes shooting up)                  Because the folks had to do their                  shit.        OFF Alonzo's amazed look:                                JAKE                  That's right.  I'm in the cop                  business to lock up the criminals                  and poisoners.  Not be one.        Alonzo sizes up Jake anew, laments not knowing that        earlier.                                ALONZO                  What happened today was --                                JAKE                  -- was murder and armed robbery.                  Wait.  We had badges, it's                  different.                                ALONZO                  Dammit, boy!  Why can't you open                  your eyes and see?        Jake can see.  Too clearly.  Softly:                                JAKE                  That man was your friend and you                  killed him like a fly.                                ALONZO                         (ice)                  We weren't friends.                         (consoling)                  All the shit you're feeling now,                  it's going to go away.  I know                  you're scared.                                JAKE                  I'm not scared.                                ALONZO                  You're terrified.  I know you are.                  Because I went through the same                  shit.  Everyone has.  Jake,                  there's gotta be dirt on you if                  anyone's gonna trust you.  After                  this is behind you, a whole new                  world will open up.  I walk a                  higher path.  I can give you the                  keys to all doors.                                JAKE                  What are you talking about?                                ALONZO                  I'm not the asskicker I once was,                  but you are.  Want to run my unit?                  My guys are good but not one of                  those clowns is a leader.  You                  are.  Want my job?  You got it.                  Wanna lock up criminals?                  This is the best place to do it.                  Do your time and make detective.                  Play the game, grow wise and                  change things from the inside.        Jake looks at him.  And realizes Alonzo is right.                                ALONZO                  Let's get to the hospital and talk                  to Stan.

Alonzo points out a well-tended, quiet, quaint house near        the Cholos.                                ALONZO                  Informant of mine's in Chino.                  Promised I'd help out his family.        Alonzo gets out.  Opens the trunk.  Loads up his arms        with appliances.                                ALONZO                  Sometimes I bring food.  Believe                  it or not, I like to help out the                  community whenever I can.                         (a box falls)                  Shit.

With Jake following.  Past staring Cholos.  A        drunk PeeWee maddogs Jake.  Jake maddogs back.                                PEEWEE                  You know where you're at, fool?

He shakes with Alonzo.                                VETERANO                  'Sup, dog.  Thought you were                  missing in action.                                ALONZO                  'Sup, man.  You know I'm never                  lost.        Jake and Alonzo cross to the house.  AD LIBS of ""Those're        cops,"" spread through the Cholos.        At the house's door, Alonzo knocks.  A beat.  A little        girl cracks it.                                ALONZO                  Hi.  Got some stuff for your                  family.        She closes it.  A beat.  The door opens to reveal SMILEY,        a huge, drunk Veterano sleeved with prison tattoos.  He        looks at the two cops.  Massive, impassive.  Smiley never        smiles.                                SMILEY                  Kitchen's this way.        Alonzo enters.  Jake hesitates.

Two fine Cholas watch the        Spanish newscast.  An old man dozes in a chair.        Family photos on the wall -- A proud line of warfighters,        lots of military uniforms.        Alonzo and Jake follow Smiley into:        INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - SUNSET        SNIPER and MORENO, big and intimidating like Smiley, have        been playing poker around a beer-bottle covered table.        Smiley, Alonzo and Jake enter.                                SMILEY                  Put it on the counter.        Alonzo and Jake place the boxes on the counter.  Sniper,        Moreno, ignore Alonzo.  And vice versa.                                ALONZO                  Can I use the head?

Alonzo exits to a hallway.  Smiley opens a box.  Pulls        out a nice CD player.                                MORENO                  That's nice.  Lemme get that.                                SMILEY                  You get the Osterizer.  This is                  mine.        Smiley opens a microwave box.  Jake reacts.        JAKE'S POV        The box is crammed with cash from Roger's locker.        BACK TO SCENE                                SMILEY                  Dreamer!  Got your bony ass in                  here!        DREAMER, 19, an attractive young lady, enters.  Smiley        stacks the heavy packages in her arms.  He tops it off        with the pillowcase of Jake's money.                                SMILEY                  Count that shit in the bedroom.

Smiley pulls a small electric money counter from a        drawer.  Dreamer's hands are full.  So he balances it on        her head.                                SMILEY                  Don't drop it.        She gives him a dirty look and exits.  Smiley takes his        seat and picks up his cards.  He eyes Moreno.                                SNIPER                  You looked at 'em.                                MORENO                  No I didn't.        Smiley tosses them to Sniper.

Sniper finishes dealing.  Jake looks at the cards        intended for him.                                JAKE                  Okay.  One hand.        Jake sits.  Now he can see a shotgun against the wall by        Moreno.  The three Cholos check their hands, signal for        more cards.  Jake checks his cards.                                MORENO                  How long you been a cop?  You look                  like you're in high school.

He ran a big game and                  owed big money.  Now Alonzo owes                  the money.                                JAKE                  How do you know?                                SMILEY                  I'm the man in the middle.  I hear                  shit.  They gave Alonzo till today                  to pay up.  His name's already on                  a list.  There's a crew up from                  Sinaloa to do the mission.                  They're gonna blast him.  No one                  thought he could get cash like                  that.                                SNIPER                  Dude made a pact with the devil or                  some shit 'cause only a miracle                  could'a saved his ass.                                JAKE                  It's no miracle.                                SNIPER                  Alonzo takes care of business.

SNIPER                  That's a stupid question.  If he's                  been to jail, he wouldn't be cop.                                JAKE                  You can be a cop as long as you've                  never been convicted of a felony.                                MORENO                  There goes my chance.

I mean                  he just slapped me.  But nothing                  happened, okay?  'Cause this cop                  came and kicked their butts.  They                  almost killed him but he kicked                  their asses.        A beat.                                SMILEY                  What did this cop look like?                                LETTY                  He was a white boy.  Brown hair.                  Tall.  He looked young.        Smiley looks at Jake.  That's him.                                SMILEY                  Sure you're okay?                                LETTY                  I'm fine.  Nothing happened.                                SMILEY                  That don't sound like nothing.                  Wanna go to the doctor?

LETTY                  I was just kicking back at my                  friend's pad.  There weren't no                  guys or nothing.  I swear to God.

And                  we're gonna talk more about this.        He hangs up.  Looks at Jake a long beat.  Soaked, bloody,        shivering.  Click.  He safeties the shotgun.  Tosses it        to a disappointed Moreno.                                MORENO                  Ain't you gonna blast him?                                SMILEY                  The vato was tellin' the truth.                  Life's a fuckin' trip, huh?                                SNIPER                  This is some trippy-ass shit.        Smiley hands the change purse to Sniper.                                SMILEY                  Get this to Letty.        Smiley stands, turns off the water.  He helps Jake to his        feet.  Unlocks the handcuffs as Jake sways, woozy.                                SMILEY                  Thanks for getting my cousin's                  back.        Jake half-smiles, not really sure if he's alive or not.        Smiley tosses him a towel.                                SMILEY                  Put that on your head.  You're                  gonna stain the carpet.  Where the                  fuckers at?  Where'd you book                  them?

Jake sits in a chair holding a bloody towel on his head.        Smiley returns his badgecase and gun.                                JAKE                  Thanks.                                SMILEY                  You know this shit was just                  business.                                JAKE                  I know.

Smiley tosses the pillowcase of Jake's money on the        table.                                SMILEY                  Alonzo gave me that to take care                  of you.  To burn you up on the                  freeway by your house.  I don't                  want his blood money.  So... I                  don't know.  I just don't want it.                                JAKE                  I'll take it.        Jake picks up the pillowcase and hugs it.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT        Smiley walks Jake past the Cholos, staring at the beaten,        wet cop.  Jake hugs the pillowcase.  Out in the street:                                SMILEY                  I know Alonzo paid off his debt,                  but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow                  to make the call.  His magic ran                  out.        Jake and Smiley shake hands.                                SMILEY                  Sure you don't wanna ride?                                JAKE                  I'm sure.        As Jake walks away:                                SMILEY                  You went Sega today, rookie.                  You're at that next level.

It rolls out to reveal        Jake and his pillowcase.  Just standing there on the        curb.        JAKE'S POV        The cul-de-sac.  No man's land.  And very dark, the        streetlights have been shot out.  Deceptively quiet,        except for the little kid riding away on his bike.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT        Jake enters, wary.  He rounds the misparked van.  And        sees the street is quiet.  The glow of a cigarette on the        roof of an apartment building catches his eye.        He looks at a building across the street.  Sees movement,        a shadow, like someone taking cover.        ON HOUSE        A light turns off.  The curtain in the window moves.        Jake swallows hard and keeps walking toward Sara's        apartment.  The G-Ride parked out front.        ON DRIVEWAY        Thirteen men pour out like hornets from a hive.  They are        the gangsters he saw earlier.  The bench presser leads        the way, like a cat that has found a spider to play with.        Jake stares unwaveringly into the man's eyes.        Bench presser looks at the pillowcase curiously --        Smack!        -- Jake threw a roundhouse at his throat, solidly        connecting.        Bench presser drops on one knee. He struggles for a        breath.  Clutches his throat.  His homies stare in        disbelief.        ON JAKE        He takes a deep breath.        TILT DOWN --        Jake's police handcuffs orbit his fist like brass        knuckles.        The gangsters stare at him.                                JAKE                  I have business with Alonzo.        It's in his eyes, he will not back down.  A gangster with        intelligent eyes, obviously next in the chain of command,        sizes up Jake.  A beat.        He gestures for Jake to go ahead.  Jake steps around the        bench presser, only now getting air through his windpipe.        Jake walks into their midst.        Their faces follow him.  They are behind him, around him.        He is outnumbered by these hardened streetfighters.  Jake        prays he isn't bum-rushed.        Now past them, he continues walking toward Sara's        building.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. SARA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT        Sara sits on the couch, clutching her son.  Watching TV        in the dark.  Something is wrong, she's almost catatonic.        We hear MOANS and GIGGLING O.S.        ANGLE        to see Sara has a black eye.        BANG!  The FRONT DOOR flies open.  It's Jake, his gun        out.        Jake and Sara look at each other a long beat.  Two        battered faces in a dead TV glow.  She points at the        bedroom.        Jake crosses, opens the door.  Enters.        INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT        It's a bitch sandwich and Alonzo's in the middle.  Jake        crosses to the foot of the bed.  Stands there.  From        inside the writhing flesh pile:                                ALONZO                  'Bout time you changed your mind                  and joined in.        The two women stare at Jake, naked and immodest.  It        takes a beat for Alonzo to recognize the ghost before        him.        Jake dumps the money on the blankets.                                JAKE                  Smiley didn't want the job.        Alonzo's eyes bug in horror at the mountain of cash.  He        ages a hundred years in a second.  A man who knows he        will soon be dead.        ON JAKE        with eyes colder and blacker than a shark's.  Alonzo can        fool him no more.                                JAKE                  Know what I learned today?  It's                  not about money.        He turns, about to walk away.  And turns back around.        The women shriek, dive out of the line of fire.  Alonzo        braces for bullets and instead hears:                                JAKE                  It's about respect.        Jake leaves.  As he crosses the --        INT. LIVING ROOM                                ALONZO (O.S.)                  ... Oh, God...        Jake exits the apartment.        ON SARA        A smile slowly spreads across her face.                                                   CUT TO:        EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT        As Jake descends the stairs, the porch lights of a house        come on.  Then the lights of another house.        Steel doors open.  People tentatively step outside.        Women and children, mothers with babies on their hips.        Blue-collar fathers in shop uniforms.        More porch lights come on.  More doors open.        JAKE'S POV        The cul-de-sac has come to life.  The homes are lit,        their occupants filling the street, ready to bear        witness.        BACK TO SCENE        All eyes on Jake as he walks down the street.  Three        young boys follow him.        The old woman comes out of her house to watch Jake pass.        As do two pretty girls.        Jake nearing the gangsters.  They block the street.  The        bench presser stands there, arms crossed, Jake will have        to go through him again.        Curious eyes wonder what will happen.        The bench presser gives Jake a slight nod of respect.        The gangsters part for Jake and he leaves the cul-de-sac.        ON JAKE        As he walks, his innocence is gone, a heavy burden on his        shoulders, but there is much strength in his gait.        Jake walks past the aloof little kid, riding his bicycle        in tight circles.  He smiles at Jake.  Jake smiles back.                                                   CUT TO:        INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT        Lisa watches TV on the couch, snuggling with a cup of        tea, worried.  Headlights sweep the curtains.  A car        pulls into the driveway.        Lisa smiles, sets down her tea, sprawls on the couch like        she's sleeping, opens her robe provocatively, arranges it        just right.        We hear the front DOOR OPEN O.S.  FOOTSTEPS as Jake moves        through the house.  Lisa peeks, sees him enter the baby's        room in silhouette.                                LISA                         (sotto)                  Guess I'm second in line tonight.        She rises, crosses to the bedroom and enters.        INT. BEDROOM - LISA'S POV        Jake's back is to her, holding his daughter tight.        BACK TO SCENE        Lisa lays a hand on his shoulder.  He turns slowly,        reveals his broken, swollen face.  And a look in his eyes        that says he will never be the same.        Lisa sees this and starts crying.  She holds him tightly        in her arms.        He holds onto his wife and child for dear life.
